## Cúram 8.1.2

Cúram by Merative™ is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process. v8.1.2.0 includes key enhancements to our portal capabilities, caseworker efficiency, and developers productivity.

### Persona based portal - Additional portal capability

We are excited to announce the expansion of our modern portal capabilities. Our enhanced solution empowers clients to build portals tailored to new personas, including authorised representatives.

To support clients in buildiing tailored portals we will be providiing a sample portal and guidance to demonstrate how this capability can be implemented.

### Caseworker efficiency - Multi lingual support

Multilingual support provides efficiency gains for caseworkers by displaying the interface in the user's language of choice removing need for on the fly translation. In v8.1.2.0, we are extending multilingual support in Cúram to cater for the display of eligibility results throughout the caseworker application.

### Developer productivity

Introduced a hookpoint into the payments generation process so that developers can compliantly customize the logic that determine payments due and thus meet specific agency requirements.
