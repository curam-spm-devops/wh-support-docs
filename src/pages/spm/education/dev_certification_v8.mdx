#### Helpful Advice for Passing the Test

Here is some advice that the Cúram Education team has gathered over the years from test takers to help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ **Create a schedule**: There is a lot of material to review. The Customization course book contains 360 pages. In addition, you need to practice the skills you’ve learned in a Cúram development environment. Create a schedule with weekly deadlines so that you are not overwhelmed. Expect to spend about 30 – 40 hours preparing for the test after you complete the training courses. Do not leave too long a gap between completing the courses and preparing for the test. Note that additional features and details that are provided in the appendix of the course book are not examinable on the test.
+ **Safety in numbers**: If possible, set up a study group to help meet deadlines and to support each other. Members often present topics to each other as a way of reviewing the material.
+ **Know the test objectives**: The test objectives list the topics that you will be asked about. The objectives are closely aligned with the content of the training course. Copy the objectives to a spreadsheet and mark them off as you review them in the material and perform the associated skill in the ADE.
+ **Be systematic**: Adopt a systematic approach when preparing, for example:
    + Review the lesson in the course book, including the notes.
    + Complete the exercise for the lesson. Note that you can load the sample solution of the previous exercise if necessary. Try to do the exercise without referring to the detailed steps.
    + It is often useful to review the relevant section of the developer documentation to get an alternative explanation.
+ **Make summary notes**: It’s useful to make summary notes or mind maps of topics, for example, key UIM elements, build commands, and the purpose of each application navigation file. The appendix includes some summaries, such as entity stereotypes.
+ **Get hands-on practice**: The test will feature practical development scenarios that assess your understanding of key concepts. To succeed, you need to **actively practice** the skills you’ll be tested on. This is the most effective way to prepare and retain the vast amount of material. Remember, practice is crucial to mastering the content—aim to spend as much time practicing the skills as you do studying them. It is best to use the lab that you used for *CUR091 - Merative Cúram for Developers (Customization) 8.X*. If this lab has expired, the same lab is available for *CUR091 - Merative Cúram for Developers (Customization) 8.X* and *CUR092 – Merative Cúram Development Environment 8.X: Sandbox*. The lab provides a lightweight project (CourseWorkshop) where you can practice ADE development and customization with very short build times.  The lab also contains a standard development environment where you can perform more realistic customizations. The lab contains sample solutions for course exercises. See the *ReadMe Guide* for details.
+ **Challenge your understanding**: Once you are confident that you can complete the course exercises, add features to the case study and customize it in the CourseWorkshop project. The *Cúram V8.X ADE Customization Certification Preparation – Mini Project* lists features that you can add to your case study. Detailed steps are not provided so that you must think about which artifacts to change and how to change them.

+ **Are you ready?**
    + Ten sample test questions can be found here: [C005_SampleTestQuestions.pdf](/pdf/education/C005_SampleTestQuestions.pdf)
    + Ask a senior developer or mentor to check if you are ready. The mentor can ask questions to test your understanding of the topics.
    + Take the practice test, P005 – Cúram V8.X Customization – Practice, in Prometric - It is recommended that you take the Practice Test at least four days before you plan to take the actual test.
+ **When taking the test**: Tips for answering the test questions:
    + Read all the information in the question.  
    + For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tell you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…” and be followed by the prompt “Select 3”. Use these indicators to help you select or reject options.
    + Do a quick first pass and answer the easier questions first.
    + You can simplify multiple-answer questions by treating each option as a true/false question. 
    + Use the features in the tool to strike out options, highlight text, flag questions, and review attempted, unattempted and flagged questions.  Before you begin the test, you will complete a tutorial that explains these features.
+ **How did you do?** After you complete the Practice Test and the Certification Test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the tested sections. If you do not pass the test, this report can help you to identify the areas that need more attention before you try again. If you do not pass the first time, don’t give up. Many people take two or more attempts to pass it.
