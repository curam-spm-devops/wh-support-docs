The Cúram Certification Program helps you to become a valuable Cúram resource to your customers, colleagues, and Cúram implementation project.
Each test contains multiple-choice questions that require either a single answer or multiple answers. For multiple-answer questions, you need to choose all required options to answer the question correctly. You will be advised how many correct options you need to select to get the overall question right.

The tests are closed-book tests, so you cannot refer to any course materials or other information during your test session. There is no negative marking or partial marking. The test language is English.

If you fail an Accreditation or a Certification Test at your first attempt, you can schedule a second test appointment immediately. If your second attempt is also unsuccessful, you must wait 30 days before scheduling your third test appointment.

Each Accreditation and Certification Test has an associated Practice Test that you can use to prepare for the Test.

The Cúram Education Team currently offers the following tests:

*C001 – Cúram SPM V7.X Application Developer – Certification (Cost $300)*

<!--***Note - V8 Developer Tests***

You must pass both tests to gain certification and be designated a Cúram Certified Developer. If you pass the first test (C004), you are designated a Cúram Accredited Developer. For some people, this may be all they need, or all they need in the short term. To be designated a Cúram Certified Developer, you must pass C004 and then pass C005.

Experienced developers may wish to take C004 and C005 on the same day. However, for people new to Cúram, it is best to take them separately to reduce the amount of information to retain and to gain experience of taking a test remotely via the Prometric ProProctor test delivery system.-->
### Recommended Schedule for V.8.X Developer Tests (C004 – ADE and C005 – Customization)

The Cúram Education Team recommends that you take C004 and C005 in numerical sequence and on separate days.

<!--TL;DR watch this video if you don't want to read all of the explanation below
<video src="V8DeveloperCertPresentation.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>-->

The recommendation is made for the following reasons:

+ It is more effective to focus on one area and one test in a day than splitting your attention between two, challenging tests over the course of a single day.
+ If you fail C004, you may not be in the right frame of mind to take another certification test on the same day.
+ If you fail C004 and decide not to take C005 on the same day, you will not be able to cancel and reschedule your original booking for C005 without being charged again.
+ The availability of remote proctors varies day-to-day. Depending on demand and how far in advance you make a booking, you may not be able to arrange two back-to-back appointments.

The above advice is not mandatory. You can decide to attempt both tests on the same day. Bear in mind that you will not be deemed a Cúram Certified Developer or receive your Certificate and Badge until you pass both tests.
