When sending a request for a Cúram Certification Test, **it is crucial that you provide the correct version of your first name and last name**. The first name and last name that you provide **must match your first name and last name as they display on the photo ID** that you use to prove your identity at the start of your Certification Test session. Cúram Certification Tests are delivered by Prometric, a test administration provider. All Cúram Certification Tests are delivered remotely via the Prometric ProProctor online test delivery system. At the start of the test session, the proctor will examine your photo ID to ensure that the first name and last name on the ID match your first name and last name as they are recorded on the Prometric system. The Cúram Education Team uses the first name and last name that you provided in your test request to register you on the Prometric system.
