## C004 – Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation

### Test Overview and Structure

This accreditation confirms that the successful candidate has the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to design, build, execute, and deploy Curam V8.X applications by using the Cúram Application Development Environment (ADE).

The test contains three sections that together provide a total of 50 questions. The weight reflects the percentage and number of questions in each test section.

| Section | Weight | Topics |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Cúram Infrastructure | 20% (10 questions) | Components of Cúram, runtime architecture, project folders, build targets, tracing and troubleshooting |
| Server-Side Development | 50% (25 questions) | Classes and relationships, stereotype operations, class hierarchies, code tables, message files, validation and exception handling, and importing and exporting configuration data |
| Client-Side Development | 30% (15 questions) | UIM elements; pages for create, read, modify, and search applications; application navigation; adding logic to pages and introduction to widgets |

Each test section has a set of objectives, which you can use to identify the areas of knowledge and skills that the section covers.

The passing score is 70% (35 correct questions out of 50).

To earn C004 – Cúram V8.X ADE – Accreditation, follow these high-level steps:

1. Master the material and  exercises in the following course - by taking instructor-led or self-paced training:
    + *CUR090 - Merative Cúram for Developers (ADE) 8.X*
2. Review the test sections and identify the associated objectives and topics.
3. Test your understanding by completing the mini-projects, Knowledge Assessment, and readiness mentoring (if available). 
4. Take the Practice Test (P004) to see if you are prepared for the Accreditation Test (C004). 
5. Register for the Accreditation Test.
6. Take and pass the Accreditation Test.

#### Helpful Advice for Passing the Test

Here is some advice that the Cúram Education team has gathered over the years from test takers to help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ **Create a schedule**: There is a lot of material to review – the ADE course book contains almost 400 pages. Note that the additional information in the appendix is not examinable. However, the Tips section, which provides summaries of key concepts from the course, is examinable. The ADE course book contains almost 400 pages. In addition, you need to practice the skills you’ve learned in a Cúram development environment. Create a schedule with weekly deadlines so that you are not overwhelmed. Expect to spend about 30 – 40 hours preparing for the test after you complete the training courses. Do not leave too long a gap between completing the courses and preparing for the test. Note that additional features and details that are provided in the appendix of the course book are not examinable on the test.


+ **Safety in numbers**: If possible, set up a study group to help meet deadlines and to support each other. Members often present topics to each other as a way of reviewing the material.


+ **Know the test objectives**: The test objectives list the topics that you will be asked about. The objectives are closely aligned with the content of the training course. Copy the objectives to a spreadsheet and mark them off as you review them in the material and perform the associated skill in the ADE.


+ **Be systematic**: Adopt a systematic approach when preparing, for example:
    + Review the lesson in the course book, including the notes.
    + Complete the exercise for the lesson. Note that you can load the sample solution of the previous exercise if necessary. Try to do the exercise without referring to the detailed steps.
    + It is often useful to review the relevant section of the developer documentation to get an alternative explanation.


+ **Make summary notes**: It’s useful to make summary notes or mind maps of topics, for example, key UIM elements, build commands, and the purpose of each application navigation file. The appendix includes some summaries, such as entity stereotypes.


+ **Get hands-on practice**: The test will feature practical development scenarios that assess your understanding of key concepts. To succeed, you need to **actively practice** the skills you’ll be tested on. This is the most effective way to prepare and retain the vast amount of material. Remember, practice is crucial to mastering the content—aim to spend as much time practicing the skills as you do studying them. It is best to use the lab that you used for *CUR090 - Merative Cúram for Developers (ADE) 8.X*. If this lab has expired, the same lab is available for *CUR091 - Merative Cúram for Developers (Customization) 8.X* and *CUR092 – Merative Cúram Development Environment 8.X: Sandbox*. The lab provides a lightweight project (CourseWorkshop) where you can practice ADE development with very short build times. The lab contains sample solutions for course exercises. You can load the solution for any exercise to enable you to practice the subsequent exercise. See the *ReadMe Guide* for details.


+ **Challenge your understanding**: Once you are confident that you can complete the course exercises, add features to the case study and customize it in the CourseWorkshop project. The *Cúram V8.X ADE Accreditation Preparation – Mini Project* lists features that you can add to your case study. Detailed steps are not provided so that you must think about which artifacts to change and how to change them.

+ **Are you ready?**
    + Take the Knowledge Assessment in Moodle. Each time you take the assessment, you are asked 20 random questions from a pool of 45. You can attempt the assessment up to 5 times. Note that this assessment is not a replacement credential for the ADE Accreditation Test. You will not receive any badge, credential, or qualification for taking this assessment. It is intended solely as a way to measure your grasp of key concepts covered in the course and/or to help you to prepare for ADE Accreditation. In addition, the assessment includes different question types – such as drag and drop – that are not in the Practice and Accreditation tests. 
    + If possible, ask a senior developer or mentor to check if you are ready. The mentor can ask questions to test your understanding of the topics.
    + Ten sample test questions can be found here: [C004_SampleTestQuestions.pdf](/pdf/education/C004_SampleTestQuestions.pdf). These will give you an understanding of the types and format of the Practice and Accreditation questions.
    + Take the practice test, P004 – Cúram V8.X ADE – Practice, in Prometric - It is recommended that you take the Practice Test at least four days before you plan to take the actual test.


+ **When taking the test**: Tips for answering the test questions:
    + Read all of the information in the question.  
    + For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tell you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…” and be followed by the prompt “Select 3”. Use these indicators to help you select or reject options.
    + Do a quick first pass and answer the easier questions first.
    + You can simplify multiple-answer questions by treating each option as a true/false question. 
    + Use the features in the tool to strike out options, highlight text, flag questions, and review attempted, unattempted, and flagged questions.  Before you begin the test, you will complete a tutorial that explains these features. 
    + In general trust the first answer you give. 


+ **How did you do?** After you complete the Practice Test and the Accreditation Test, you will receive a score report showing how many questions you answered correctly for each of the three tested sections. If you do not pass the test, this report can help you to identify the sections that need more attention before you try again. If you do not pass the first time, don’t give up. Many people take two or more attempts to pass it.
