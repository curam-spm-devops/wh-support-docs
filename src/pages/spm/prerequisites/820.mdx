### Development Tools

Note that the development of the application is restricted to the Windows platform (Windows 11) and the listed tools have been tested only on that platform.

Although technical support is not provided for any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) it should be possible to use any Java IDE for development. Support for IDEs should be sought from the relevant software vendor. The Eclipse IDE has been tested and it's use is described in the documentation.

Java is required for Cúram development and the versions listed below are certified for this purpose. Other Java distributions which are not listed below may be used for Cúram development. However, they have not been certified. Any Cúram product related issues related to Cúram development and a Java distribution not
listed below should be raised through the normal Cúram support channels.

|Supported software|Version|Details|
|------------------|-------|-------|

### Reporting and Analysis

Eclipse Business Intelligent and Reporting Tools (BIRT) is an open source component that provides a development and execution environment for Cúram Business Intelligence (BI) content.

The use of a second Eclipse instance for BIRT development is recommended as standard Cúram development often requires an Eclipse version that is not compatible with the certified BIRT development environment.

For more information, see the Development Environment Installation Guide and the BIRT Developer Guide.

|Supported software|Version|Details|
|------------------|-------|-------|
|Eclipse Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools|4.8.0 and future fix packs|Cúram uses the all-in-one installation. For more information, see [BIRT versions and platform support](https://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/drops/).|

### Web Browser Plug-Ins

Java is required to run the Word Integration Assistant client desktop Java™ application which is part of the Word Integration
feature. The Java version specified in the table below is certified for this purpose.
Other Java distributions which are not listed below may be used for running the Word Integration Assistant. However, they have 
not been certified. Any Cúram product related issues related to running the Word Integration Assistant against a Java distribution not
listed below should be raised through the normal Cúram support channels.

|Supported software|Version|Details|

### Web Browsers

The minimum recommended resolution is 1366x768. The optimum DPI setting is Normal size.

Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari release new versions frequently and install updates automatically by default. Merative Cúram releases (V.R.M.F releases only) are generally tested on the latest version (for Chrome and Edge, stable releases only) of these browsers available at the start of the development cycle; if tested with no issues Merative will certify that version. The prerequisites advise the version that is certified at each new product release. If for any reason, Merative Cúram are unable to certify for that version, it may be necessary to revert back to a version that is previously fully certified. While Merative will support customers on newer versions of these browsers than the last certified version, they should understand that they have not been fully tested.

#### Standard desktop browser support

While every effort is made to ensure that internal case worker application pages use standard web technologies and formats that are compatible with all browsers, only the listed browsers are officially supported.

#### Universal Access desktop browser support

Universal Access has been specifically developed for public facing applications so browser support has been extended in this area.

* For information about browser support for the Universal Access Responsive Web Application, see the prerequisites and supported software in the [Universal Access Responsive Web Application documentation](/spm/pdf-documentation#citizen-engagement).
* While every effort is made to ensure that the classic Universal Access application uses standard web technologies and formats that are compatible with all browsers, only the listed browsers are officially supported.

|Supported software|Version|Details|
|------------------|-------|-------|
|Google Chrome|130 and future fix packs|This browser is supported for both the Universal Access and Case Worker applications. Microsoft Word Integration  and Arabic (RTL) are supported for this browser in the Case Worker application.|
|Microsoft Edge|130 and future fix packs|This browser is supported for both the Universal Access and Case Worker applications. Microsoft Word Integration  and Arabic (RTL) are supported for this browser in the Case Worker application.|
|Mozilla Firefox|132 and future fix packs| This browser is supported only for the Universal Access application.|
