SPM-138875,,Batch Performance Improvements: Managing caches and multiple transactions in batch processes,CEF,Technical Services,Server Development Environment,Batch Processing,"*Issue Description:* 
Four property updates are required to benefit from the batch processing performance improvements. The following application properties are now available to help improve batch processing performance.

*Steps to Configure four properties for batch improvements:*

*Property Name:* Clear caches per case in chunked batch
*Technical ID:* curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.<instanceID>
*Category:* Application - Batch settings
*Type:* 32 bit Integer
*Default value:* 0

For chunked batch jobs that execute reassessments, increasing the chunk size raises the memory demand of the streamer. This can prevent large chunk sizes from being utilized. Part of this memory demand is caused by two transaction-level caches: the SQL Query cache and the Persistence Infrastructure (PI) cache, whose sizes increase over the duration of a chunk.

It is now possible to enable either or both of these transaction-level caches to be cleared at the end of processing each case in the chunk instead of waiting for the end of the chunk, thereby stopping the memory demand from increasing proportionally to the size of the chunk. The property name takes the format 'curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.<instanceID>' where <instanceID> identifies a type of chunked batch program.

Valid values of <instanceID> can be found in the code table 'Batch Process Chunk Name'. Valid values for this property are as follows:

0 - Cache clearing off (i.e. the transaction-level caches will be cleared at the end of the chunk).
1 - Clear the  PI cache at the end of processing each case.
2 - Clear SQL Query cache at the end of processing each case.
3 - Clear both caches at the end of processing each case. 

*Example 1:*    
To clear both caches per case for 'CREOLE Bulk Case Chunk Reassessment by Product':  curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.BPN6=3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

*Example 2:*
To clear only the PI cache per case for 'Generate Instruction Line Items':  curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.BPN1=1.

_As with all caches, there is a trade-off between memory usage and fetching data from the database. Although clearing a cache more frequently will lessen the memory demand, it will also require some data to be reloaded more frequently. The overall gain or loss will be dependent on the content of the data being processed._

Note that since this is an optional property for out-of-the-box and custom chunked batch programs it is not automatically available in the Property Administration screen. To use this property for a chunked batch program you must first add it by clicking the New button in the Property Administration screen.



*Property Name:* Cache CER rates per transaction
*Technical ID:* curam.cache.cer.rate
*Category:* Application - Cache settings
*Type:* Boolean
*Default value:* false

By default, CER rates are included in the PI cache for the duration of a transaction. If the PI cache gets cleared at the end of each case during a chunk, rates must be re-read from the database more often. To mitigate the performance overhead in re-reading CER rates during a transaction, a separate transaction-level cache for CER rates can be enabled by setting this property to True.



*Property Name:* Enable transaction-level cache for query CaseNomineeProdDelPattern.readByEffectiveDate
*Technical ID*: curam.casenomineeproddelpattern.readbyeffectivedate.cache
*Category:* Application - Cache settings
*Type:* Boolean
*Default value:* false

When reassessing long-lived cases, for example, above ten years, on which payments have been issued, the table CaseNomineeProdDelPattern is queried very heavily for each past payment period on which payment could have been made for the case. This is especially evident when reassessing cases after applying a rate change. The entity operation is 'CaseNomineeProdDelPattern.readByEffectiveDate', and the SQL for the query is: 

SELECT CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERNID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.FROMDATE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.PRODUCTDELIVERYPATTERNID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.STATUSCODE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.VERSIONNO FROM CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN WHERE CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEID= ? AND CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.STATUSCODE= ? AND ( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.FROMDATE <= ? ) AND (( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE>= ? ) OR ( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE IS NULL) )

This can place a large processing load on the database. To mitigate this processing load, it is now possible to optionally consolidate the multiple queries on table CaseNomineeProdDelPattern into a single query per case per transaction by setting this property to True.



*Property Name:* Batch Chunk Record Insert/Delete Commit Size
*Technical ID:* curam.batch.chunker.recordinsertdeletecommitsize
*Category:* Application - Batch settings
*Type:* 32 bit Integer
*Default value:* 10000000

By default, chunked batch programs use a single transaction to insert the chunk records at the start, and another single transaction to delete them at the end. For batch jobs with a very large number of chunks, these large transactions can consume excessive transaction log space in the database. This property allows you to specify a maximum number of chunk records per transaction at both the start and end of a chunked batch run. If the number of chunks exceeds this value, the inserts and deletes will be executed in a series of smaller transactions.

"
SPM-137941,,data-test-ids are not unique on pages where a FIELD LABEL property is referenced by more than one FIELD,CEF,,,,"*Issue Description:*
When more than one FIELD element in a UIM page shares the same property key for their LABEL attribute, the generated data-testid HTML attribute for the rendered FIELD elements is the same.

*User Interface Impact:* No.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Update a UIM page so that two FIELD elements share the same property key for their LABEL attribute.
# Run the appropriate client builds and restart the Cúram application.
# Log in to the Cúram application and navigate to the updated page.
# Inspect the HTML for the two fields sharing the same label.
# Issue: The data-testid for the two fields is the same. They should be unique.

*Resolution:*
When more than one FIELD element in a UIM page shares the same property key for their LABEL attribute, the generated data-testid HTML attribute for the rendered FIELD elements is unique. When the data-testid is being generated but it is already present on the page, a suffix is appended to make the current data-testid unique. For example, if the data-testid textinput&#95;Field.Label.Name has been generated but is already on the page; the current data-testid will be updated to textinput&#95;Field.Label.Name_1 to make it unique.

"
SPM-137702,,Distribute BatchProcessChunk insert+delete into multiple transactions if the number of chunks available is exceeded,CEF,Technical Services,Server Development Environment,Batch Processing,"*Issue Description:*
Chunked batch programs use a single large transaction to insert chunks at the start of the batch run, and another single large transaction to remove them at the end. This places a strain on the database transaction log for batch programs with large numbers of chunks.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*
This issue is dependent on user data and as such is not directly reproducible.

*Resolution:*
The application property 'curam.batch.chunker.recordinsertdeletecommitsize' enables a maximum number of chunk records to be specified per transaction at the start and end of a chunked batch run. If the number of chunks available exceeds this value, the insert and deletes will be executed in a series of smaller transactions instead of a single large transaction.

"
SPM-137063,DT037095,Performance enhancement for setting the last paid to date for case nominee components,ENT,Financial Management,Financials,,"*Issue Description:*
The repetitive nature of the SQL used to set the ?last paid to date? for nominee components results in very long reassessment times. This is particularly noticeable for products utilizing list objectives, especially when the number of list objectives being processed is very high, potentially in the thousands.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# A case exists whose underlying product utilises list objectives.
# Evidence is captured on the product delivery, translating into thousands of list objectives at runtime.
# Issue: The time spent (re)assessing this product delivery is excessive due to the repetitive nature of the SQL. The same SQL is executed for every list objective (there could be thousands), even when the ?last paid to date? is the same for all of them.

*Resolution:*
The functionality has been updated to use a hash map keyed on a combination of case nominee and objective. If these are the same for all list objectives, the SQL is only executed once, rather than potentially thousands of times. This significantly improves the efficiency of the (re)assessment process when dealing with list objectives.

SPM-136566,DT037082,Expensive query across Dependency and PrecedentChangeItem tables for each reassessment,CEF,Integrated Case Management,Eligibility & Entitlement,Data Access Layer,"*Issue Description:*
When a case is reassessed by the Dependency Manager, a database query is executed to identify which precedents caused the reassessment. This is done to derive the probable reason for the reassessment, which is then displayed in the ?Reason? column of the Determination History for the case. The possible values displayed in this column are: 'Rules Change', 'System Configuration Change', and 'Case Reassessment'. In systems with large numbers of cases and a high volume of records in the Dependency table, this query can consume significant database time and resources. In the out-of-the-box application, this query is used solely to populate the display field and is not essential for any other processing.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:* 

# Enable JMX report generation for batch programs by setting the property 'Write a JMX report to disk at the end of each batch program.' to True.
# Run the Dependency Manager batch suite, ensuring that some cases are awaiting processing by the batch.
# Check attribute 'SQLStats' of the resulting JMX report for the presence of operation Dependency.searchDistinctPrecedentsByDependentAndPrecedentChangeSetWithHash .
# Issue: The JMX report will indicate that the method was called once per case reassessment and may contribute significantly to overall SQL execution times.

*Resolution:*
The query can be suppressed by setting the application property 'curam.reassess.contributing.precedents.search.disabled' to True. Reassessments triggered by the dependency manager will no longer execute the expensive query.

Specifically, it is challenging to know when each chunk was written, when each chunk was completed, how long it took to process each chunk, how many records were skipped in each chunk, which streamer instance processed each chunk, and whether there was any contention among streamer instances when obtaining chunk key values.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Execute a long-running batch program, for example, 'Bulk Case Chunk Reassessment by Product' will reassess all active cases, which can take many hours.
# Launch some streamer instances for the batch program launched above.
# Issue: While the batch chunk tables BatchProcessChunk and BatchChunkKey can indicate progress, there is no central location to monitor the health of the batch program and its streamers.

*Resolution*:
Additional columns have been added to table BatchProcessChunk to indicate:

* when the chunk was created
* when the chunk was completed
* the number of milliseconds taken to complete the chunk
* the number of records skipped in the chunk
* the process ID of the streamer instance which processed the chunk
* the length of time taken to obtain the key of the chunk
* the number of retries to obtain the key of the chunk
While the batch is in progress this provides a central location to assist an administrator to monitor the progress and overall health of the batch job by querying the BatchProcessChunk table. For example:
* determine whether it is taking excessive time to create the chunk records
* determine whether the number of skipped records is abnormal
* determine that all streamer instances are processing chunks at a normal rate
* determine if there is excessive contention in obtaining chunk keys

As before, the records from the BatchProcessChunk entity are cleaned up at the end of each batch run. However, it is now possible to save the statistics captured for each chunk. The statistics from the newly added fields can be written to a tab-delimited text file at the end of the batch run. This file is suitable for importing or pasting into a spreadsheet for later analysis. This report will be generated when the application property ?curam.batch.streams.writechunkerlogfile? is set to ?True?.

SPM-135600,,Ellipses at the end of action control labels are inconsistent between person and case evidence,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
The use of ellipses at the end of action control labels is inconsistent between person and case evidence.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce (Generic):*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a person and create an integrated case.
# Create and activate evidence on the integrated case.
# Expand each evidence and open the Details tab.
# Issue: The [View History] action control on the person evidence has ellipses, but the [View History] action control on the case evidence does not.

*Resolution:*
Ellipses were removed from the [View History] action controls on the person home page as no additional information is required to perform the action.

SPM-135593,,Application error when action phase property on link connection not initialized,CEF,Application Development Environment,Client Development Environment,,"*Issue Description:*
When action menus or cluster buttons are configured on a modal or page, and within that configuration, a link connection with a source action phase bean has not been initialized, an application error can occur.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

*Scenario 1:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Navigate to the Cases and Outcomes tab and expand the Registration section in the shortcuts panel.
# Click on Service Supplier.
# Issue: The modal opens with an application error and no details.

*Scenario 2:*

# Log in as an administrator. 
# Navigate to Process Instance Errors under the Process Monitoring section in the shortcuts panel.
# Issue: The modal opens with an application error and no details.

*Resolution:*
Pages or modals with action menus or cluster buttons configured, and within that configuration, a link connection with a source action phase bean that has not been initialized will now display correctly and an application error will not occur.

*Technical*

An example of an action menu or cluster button configured in UIM/VIM to have an action phase property source would be something like the following with just the ACTION_CONTROL configuration.

{noformat}<ACTION_CONTROL LABEL=""""ActionControl.Label.somelabel"""">
 ...
 <LINK OPEN&#95;MODAL=""""true"""" PAGE&#95;ID=""""Page1234"""">
    <CONNECT>
      <SOURCE NAME=""""ACTION"""" PROPERTY=""""someProperty""""/>
      <TARGET NAME=""""PAGE"""" PROPERTY=""""PageParam1""""/>
    </CONNECT>
</LINK>{noformat}

Additionally to have an application error, there would be no page connection (PAGE/CONNECT element) to initialiize the action phase property.

SPM-133632,,Replace the iText library with the OpenPDF library in Cúram,Third Party Updates,,,,"iText is a Java library for creating and manipulating PDF documents. It enables developers to generate complex PDF files programmatically, including adding text, images, and tables, as well as modifying existing PDFs. Its usage in Merative Cùram is primarily focused on generating printable documentation for outcome plans.

The iText library used by Cùram has now been removed and replaced by OpenPDF version 1.3.43. OpenPDF is an open-source library for creating and manipulating PDF documents in Java, derived from the iText library version 4.2.0. It offers features for generating complex PDF files programmatically, including adding text, images and tables, as well as modifying existing PDFs.

As a result of this upgrade, several changes were made across all components of the Social Program Management application.
The changes to the JAR files include:

* EJBServercomponentsWorkspaceServiceslibiText-2.1.7.jar - iText version removed.
* CuramSDEJlibopenpdf-1.3.43.jar - openPDF version 1.3.43 added.

Note that any references in custom build scripts to the versioned JAR file should be updated to point to the new JAR file as specified above.

The impact on custom code should be minimal, but it could result in these main differences, particularly if the removed packages were previously utilized:

# OpenPDF introduced type safety with generics. For example, in the original code, final List<Chunk> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks(); might need to be replaced with final List<Element> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks();.
# The rtf.com.lowagie.text.rtf package, which is not included in OpenPDF, has been replaced by a related project called OpenRTF, available at [OpenRTF on Maven Repository|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.librepdf/openrtf].
# The rups.com.lowagie.rups package, featuring the RUPS tool for PDF inspection and manipulation, was part of the original iText library but has been excluded from OpenPDF.

SPM-133585,DT036931,An error occurs when multiple evidence pages simultaneously try to access the AppResource table for the first time,CEF,Dynamic Evidence,,,"*Issue Description:*
During dynamic evidence maintenance operations, ?The page you have requested is not available.? is sporadically seen. To resolve this problem, a server restart is required, and the page can then be reloaded successfully.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# AppResource entries with name prefixed with DynEvd_ are removed from the AppResource database table.
# The application is started in a Cluster configuration where multiple Application Server nodes are started.
# The application experiences a high load regarding dynamic evidence maintenance operations across clustered nodes.
# Issue: A sporadic 404 response is returned for a user-requested dynamic evidence page during an evidence maintenance operation. This results in the User seeing the ?The page you have requested is not available.? message. The issue occurs because of problems trying to access AppResource table data under load conditions. The failed access attempt is final on the affected node, and no further attempts to load that dynamic evidence page can be made on that node until restart.

*Resolution:*
The solution is to prevent the need for server restart whenever an attempt to load a dynamic evidence page fails. During infrastructure UI Component Model Cache loading, the infrastructure will now retry loading of dynamic evidence pages that have failed to load, thereby allowing the User additional attempts to access that page.

SPM-133492,DT036924,IEG window height is compressed when opened from an actions menu,ENT,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
When an IEG modal window is launched from an actions menu, the height of the modal is compressed, making it difficult for the user to populate the form.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*
There is no equivalent flow in the default Cúram application, so the following steps can be performed to reproduce the issue:

# Create an action menu item that opens a modal window where the user can select an intake application with only one program linked to it.
# On selecting the intake application, call the following default application UIM files, which direct the user to the IEG modal.
# The page flow should be the following in this instance: 

* Custom Modal Window > CommonIntake&#95;listInternalIntakePrograms > CommonIntake&#95;startInternalIntakeScriptPage

*Steps to Reproduce:*

*Scenario 1:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Click the New Application Form action menu item.
# Select the application and click Next to launch the IEG modal.
# Issue: If only a single program is configured in the above scenario, the IEG modal that launches has a very short height, making it difficult for the user to fill in the required details.

*Resolution:*
The IEG modal window is now launched with a minimum default height, ensuring that the modal's height is sufficient to allow the user to fill in all the required details in a more user-friendly manner.

SPM-133388,,Remove the castor JAR file from the Cúram deliverable,ENT,Universal Access,Evidence Management,Infrastructure,"*Issue Description:*

Internally, the Cúram Data Mapping Engine (CDME) uses XML data and mapping rules to transform datastore data captured by Intelligent Evidence Gathering (IEG) into evidence entities. It also uses XML data and mapping rules to populate a PDF form. This support has been updated to use the JAXB XML binding framework which replaces the one used previously which was based on an old XML framework called Castor XML.

As a result of this update, the following changes have been made to the Cúram deliverable:

1) CuramSDEJ/lib/castor-xml-0.9.5.4.jar has been removed as it is no longer used by the Cúram application.

2) EJBServer/components/WorkspaceServices/lib/WorkspaceServices.jar has been updated. Internal class method signatures have been modified but the classes modified are marked as non-accessible and not available to be called by custom code.

4) The following Castor XML-related files have been removed from the CPM component as they are no longer used:

* EJBServer/components/CPM/data/initial/blob/ProviderOfferingIndexMapping.xml
* EJBServer/components/CPM/data/initial/blob/TaxonomyMapping.xml
* EJBServer/components/CPM/data/initial/blob/TaxonomyElementMapping.xml
* EJBServer/components/CPM/data/initial/APPRESOURCE.dmx has been updated to remove the entries for the TaxonomyMapping.xml and TaxonomyElementMapping.xml files.

5) The following message IML file has been updated

* CuramSDEJmessageWorkflow.iml - removed the message RUN&#95;ID&#95;CANNOT&#95;LOAD&#95;CASTOR&#95;MAPPING&#95;FILE

SPM-132922,,Remove the superfluous CCSRemoval UIM and property files from the IV-E Eligibility webclient component,Code Removal,,,,"Child Welfare provides an unsupported sample implementation of the Title IV-E Eligibility Determination Process, which applies eligibility rules to collected information to determine if a child qualifies under Title IV-E. This can be installed as an optional component by selecting the ?IE-V&#95;Eligibility? component in the Child Welfare Installer and enabled by setting the ?curam.cfss.iveeligibility.enabled? application property to true. This results in the display of an IV-E Eligibility tab in the Ongoing Case.

The IV-E component includes a sample Classic rule set and a set of evidence to demonstrate how Title IV-E eligibility can be determined. The sample rules execute against evidence such as the child?s age, deprivation, citizenship status, and home removal information to assess the child's IV-E eligibility.

Some UIM and property files, which were originally located in the ?CFSSwebclientcomponentsChildServicesFostercareRemoval? directory but had been duplicated in the ?CFSSwebclientcomponentsIVEEligibilityOverriddenChild ServicesFostercareRemoval? directory, have been removed. These files were identical to the original ones and were redundant in the Child Welfare solution. The files removed from the ?CFSSwebclientcomponentsIVEEligibilityOverriddenChild ServicesFostercareRemoval? directory are listed below:

SPM-132471,DT036898,"When searching for available tasks, the API that retrieves the tasks performs unnecessary processing ",CEF,Administration Suite,Workflow,Workflow APIs,"*Issue Description:*
When searching for available tasks, the API that retrieves the tasks performs processing for an existing informational message that displayed the total number of outstanding available tasks for the user even though the number of tasks displayed on the search results page was limited by the property 'curam.inbox.max.task.list.size'. When a user is subscribed to a large number of work queues, the performance overhead of counting the tasks assigned to that user can be considerable.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# From the Inbox workspace, select Available Tasks below Tasks in the shortcuts panel. This will display the Available Tasks search page.
# Issue: In certain circumstances, the Available Tasks search page takes too long to load.

*Resolution:*
A new property ?curam.workflow.display.num.assigned.tasks.on.inbox.task.lists?, which is on by default, will result in the original behaviour on the Available Tasks and Task Search pages. That is, the pages will include an informational which specifies the total number of user subscribed tasks as a result of the max size being reached which is specified in the property ?curam.inbox.max.task.list.size?. 
When the new property is turned off and the results reach the max size, a new informational message is displayed to inform the user to refine their search. This will no longer require the application to count the user?s subscribed tasks.

SPM-132211,DT036880,Conditional clusters can become misaligned and do not take the entire screen width,ENT,Application Development Environment,Infrastructure,,"*Issue Description:*
On dynamic evidence screens containing un-nested conditional clusters, layout issues are observed. Clusters are incorrectly displayed as left-aligned and much narrower than they should be.

*User Interface Impact:* Yes

*Prerequisites:*
There is no equivalent flow in the default Cúram application, so the following steps can be performed to allow the issue to be reproduced.

# Configure a dynamic UIM page which has four clusters and each cluster has one field:
## The first cluster does not have any condition and is therefore displayed.
## The second cluster has a condition that is not being satisfied, resulting in the cluster not being displayed.
## The third and fourth clusters both have a condition that is being satisfied, resulting in these clusters being displayed.
# Store the dynamic UIM page and the associated .properties file in the required directory (for example, ?./custom/data/initial/clob/?) and add entries in the APPRESOURCE.dmx file for them.
# For the server interface defined on the page, model the facade operation and implement the functionality to populate the boolean conditions used for displaying the conditional clusters. 
# Add the page to the application workspace. In this example, the page is added to the person home navigation as a new tab called ?TestDynamicUIM?.
# Perform the required builds.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Click the custom navigation item ?TestDynamicUIM? on the person tab.
# Issue: Clusters three and four are left-aligned and on the same row.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*
There must be a wizard that contains at least two pages that have different widths specified in the WINDOW_OPTIONS parameter of the UIM page. The first page should be smaller than the second page.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

SPM-127662,DT036929,Container (compound) columns with text fields in lists are not sortable,CEF,Application Development Environment,Client Development Environment,Infrastructure,"*Issue Description:*
List columns with both field text and a link are not sortable. This is most prevalent on lists with the ?Add Translation? icon next to a translatable text field.  

*User Interface Impact:* Yes

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as an administrator.
# Click Work Queues below Workflow in the shortcuts panel.
# Click the ?Name? column header.
# Issue: Nothing happens. The rows are not sorted by ?Name? as expected.

SPM-127324,DT036671,The tooltips displaying phone and fax number field labels are not accessible for keyboard or mobile users,Accessibility,,,,"*Issue Description:*
In the Cúram application, several phone number and fax number input fields contain no visible labels for the individual fields that represent the different components that make up the phone or fax number, for example, a phone number's country code or the area code. Currently, the field labels are only visible via tooltips, which are visible only when hovering over an input field with a mouse or trackpad. This is an accessibility issue, as not all users navigate the page with a mouse or a trackpad. Many users rely on a keyboard for navigation or use mobile devices, so these users cannot easily determine what each field represents.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as an administrator.
# Select New User below Users in the shortcuts panel.
# Navigate to the Business Phone Number field in the Contact section.
# Using a mouse or trackpad, hover over each input field to reveal a tooltip containing the field label.
# Now navigate through each input field of the Business Phone Number using a keyboard.
# Issue: No tooltip is visible when navigating these fields using a keyboard.

*Resolution:*
The labels for the individual input fields that make up a phone or fax number are now visibly displayed on the page. 

*Technical:*
A new UIM attribute called SHOW&#95;LABELS has been added for CONTAINER elements to support this for phone or fax number input fields. The SHOW&#95;LABELS attribute default value is ?false?, so SHOW&#95;LABELS=""""true"""" must be set on the phone or fax number CONTAINER element to display the input field labels if LABEL attributes have been configured for the CONTAINER's child FIELD elements.

For more information on this new attribute, please see the CONTAINER element documentation in the UIM pages and views reference section in the _Cúram Webclient Reference Manual_.

SPM-105751,,Upgrade to the latest version of the H2 database,Third Party Updates,,,,"H2 is the Java SQL database. The main features of H2 are that it is fast, open source and contains embedded and server modes in-memory databases It also has a browser-based console application and a relatively small footprint. H2 is only supported for use in the Cúram development environment to aid application design, development and testing. H2 is not supported for use with IBM Websphere Application Server or Oracle WebLogic Server.

The version of H2 delivered with Cúram has been updated from 1.3.176 to 2.2.224. A significant number of enhancements and defect fixes are present between these two versions of H2. Please refer to [https://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html|https://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html] for further details on these.

As a result of this upgrade, the following changes have been made in the Java Development Environment deliverable.

* CuramSDEJ/lib/third&#95;party&#95;version.properties - the version of H2 has been updated.
* CuramSDEJdriversh2-2.2.224.jar - the version of H2 has been updated.


We recommend that you update any references in custom scripts and other artefacts to point to the new version of H2 that is specified above.

As well as the updates specified above, several other changes have been made in conjunction with this update.

# The connection setting of MCVCC has been discontinued in this updated version of H2. As a result, the following H2-related property, ?curam.db.h2.mvcc? which could have been specified in the Bootstrap.properties file has been removed. All references in the documentation to this property have also been removed.
# The new version of the H2 driver disallows H2 reserved words from being used as database table names, column names and in handcrafted SQL syntax. This has resulted in the introduction of a new property, ?curam.db.h2.non.keywords?, which may be used in the Bootstrap.properties to define keywords specified in custom logic which should be ignored by the H2 driver when performing this check. 
# When performing the OOTB build database command for H2, the command generated for dropping tables now contains the keyword ?CASCADE? to ensure all dependent tables are also dropped and errors do not present as a result of foreign key constraints between tables.
# The data type defined for SVR&#95;STRING&#95;SMALL for H2 was defined as a CHARACTER. The new version of H2 was padding out data for these columns with extra spaces which was causing some searches to fail when using H2. The data type for SVR&#95;STRING&#95;SMALL in H2 is now defined as a VARCHAR to alleviate this issue. 
# The function to obtain the current date and time in the DDL generated for H2 has been changed from ?CURRENT TIMESTAMP? to ?CURRENT&#95;TIMESTAMP?.
# The function to obtain the current date in the DDL generated for H2 has been changed from has been changed from ?CURRENT DATE? to ?CURRENT&#95;DATE?.
# It is recommended that H2 databases built with the previous version of the driver be removed and new instances rebuilt with the new version of the driver. 
# If a failure is encountered attempting to create a database in ?remote? mode, the ?-ifNotExists? flag may be added to your custom H2 start command if required. This must be done as the default for H2 is now not to auto-create databases when run in standalone network mode.
