SPM-139759,,Replace the iText library with the OpenPDF library in Cúram (7.0.11.0 iFix),Third Party Updates,,,,"iText is a Java library for creating and manipulating PDF documents. It enables developers to generate complex PDF files programmatically, including adding text, images, and tables, as well as modifying existing PDFs. Its usage in Merative Cùram is primarily focused on generating printable documentation for outcome plans.

The iText library used by Cúram has now been removed and replaced by OpenPDF version 1.3.43. OpenPDF is an open-source library for creating and manipulating PDF documents in Java, derived from the iText library version 4.2.0. It offers features for generating complex PDF files programmatically, including adding text, images and tables, as well as modifying existing PDFs.

As a result of this upgrade, several changes were made across all components of the Social Program Management application.
The changes to the JAR files include:

* EJBServercomponentsWorkspaceServiceslibiText-2.1.7.jar - iText version removed.
* CuramSDEJlibopenpdf-1.3.43.jar - openPDF version 1.3.43 added.

Note that any references in custom build scripts to the versioned JAR file should be updated to point to the new JAR file as specified above.

The impact on custom code should be minimal, but it could result in these main differences, particularly if the removed packages were previously utilized:

# OpenPDF introduced type safety with generics. For example, in the original code, final List<Chunk> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks(); might need to be replaced with final List<Element> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks();.
# The rtf.com.lowagie.text.rtf package, which is not included in OpenPDF, has been replaced by a related project called OpenRTF, available at [OpenRTF on Maven Repository|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.librepdf/openrtf].
# The rups.com.lowagie.rups package, featuring the RUPS tool for PDF inspection and manipulation, was part of the original iText library but has been excluded from OpenPDF. An alternative fork of RUPS can be found at [PDF Swing on Maven Repository|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.librepdf/pdf-swing].
