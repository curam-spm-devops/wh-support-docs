# OpenPDF introduced type safety with generics. For example, in the original code, final List<Chunk> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks(); might need to be replaced with final List<Element> chunks = pdfFieldCellParagraph.getChunks();.
# The rtf.com.lowagie.text.rtf package, which is not included in OpenPDF, has been replaced by a related project called OpenRTF, available at [OpenRTF on Maven Repository|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.librepdf/openrtf].
# The rups.com.lowagie.rups package, featuring the RUPS tool for PDF inspection and manipulation, was part of the original iText library but has been excluded from OpenPDF.
