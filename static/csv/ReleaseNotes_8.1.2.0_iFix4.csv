SPM-144059,DT037279,Date anomaly for May 3rd 1942 in timezone America/Puerto_Rico,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
The date May 3, 1942 is misinterpreted in the America/Puerto_Rico timezone due to an anomaly in certain versions of the Java timezone database. Specifically, the database incorrectly applies a 1-hour daylight saving time (DST) adjustment at midnight on that date. As a result, the date is shifted back to May 2, 1942 during calculations, leading to inaccurate historical date handling.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Add ?-Duser.timezone=America/Puerto_Rico? to the Default VM Arguments for the JRE being used.
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a person with their date of birth as May 3, 1942.
# Issue: Their date of birth is incorrectly displayed as May 2, 1942.

*Resolution:*
A special case has been added to handle this anomaly and ensure accurate date calculations.

SPM-143970,DT036603,Specific task types are not closed automatically by the application after incoming evidence issues have been resolved,CEF,Business Services,Workflow,,"*Issue Description:*
The following three problematic scenarios relating to tasks have been raised:

Scenario 1: 'No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval' task could be closed off manually even without a supervisor available. 

Scenario 2: 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task does not close automatically when incoming evidence is resolved.

Scenario 3: 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' task can not be manually closed when in-edit evidence is resolved.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

*Scenario 1:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Create an integrated case.
# Create a product delivery case.
# Update the Position and PositionReportingLink database tables as follows. This removes supervisors from the organizational structure.
## UPDATE POSITION SET LEADPOSITIONIND = '0'
## UPDATE POSITIONREPORTINGLINK SET RECORDSTATUS = 'RST2'
# Submit the product delivery for approval.
# Navigate to the tasks tab on the product delivery.
# Click the task ?No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval.?
# On the task home page, select 'Confirm that the supervisor exists'.
# Click Yes on the dialog box to confirm.
# Issue: The task gets closed without the supervisor present.

*Scenario 2:*

# Log in as an administrator.
# Select Evidence Sharing within Rules and Evidence on the shortcuts panel.
# Create an identical evidence-sharing configuration from one integrated case type to another integrated case type.
# Set Trusted Source = No.
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Create two integrated cases for the registered person, i.e. the types configured for sharing in the previous step.
# On the first case, navigate to the evidence tab.
# Add evidence and apply evidence changes.
# On the second case, a 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task is created within the Tasks tab.
# Navigate to the Evidences tab and select incoming evidence.
# Resolve the incoming evidence by adding it to the case.
#  Issue: The task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' is not closed even after the incoming evidence is resolved.

*Scenario 3:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Submit an application.
# On the application case, delete some evidence that would trigger mandatory evidence validations on the related integrated case.
# Authorize the application case.
# On the integrated case that gets created, evidence failed to activate and a new task 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' is created within the Tasks tab.
# Navigate to the evidence tab and apply changes to activate the evidence on the integrated case.
# A validation error for the mandatory evidence is displayed.
# Add the missing evidence and apply evidence changes. 
# Open the task and click ?Add To My Tasks?.
# Now click Close on the task.
# Issue: An error message appears preventing the task from being closed: ?Task XXX cannot be closed from this page.?

*Resolution:*
Scenario 1: Validations have been included to confirm that a supervisor exists before the task gets closed.

Scenario 2: This issue has been resolved and the task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' gets closed when all the incoming evidence is resolved.

Scenario 3: It is now possible to manually close the task. A new version of the AdvancedEvidenceSharingInEditTask workflow has been added to facilitate this manual closure.

*Upgrade Impact:*
For Scenario 3, any existing in-progress tasks will be created using the old workflow version. These tasks will not be affected by the new workflow, and a caseworker will still not be able to manually close them. Once the new workflow version is released and deployed, new tasks will be created, and a caseworker will be able to manually close them.

SPM-143845,DT037252,Disabled inline action menu configuration can cause NullPointerException errors to be sent to server logs,CEF,,,,"*Issue Description:*
When the system administration configuration properties for inline action menus are disabled, for example, by removing the properties from the Cúram applications? Application.prx or Environment.xml file, a NullPointerException may occur, potentially leading to degraded application performance over time.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*
Customize the Environment.xml file to remove th_e ?_curam.actionmenus.display-inline.enabled.tab? and 'curam.actionmenus.max-inline-items.tab' properties. Then build the database again.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a person.
# Continue using the application until you encounter an error, either an ?Application Error? or a ?Sorry, an error has occurred? error when opening a browser tab.
# Inspect the server logs.
# Issue: A NullPointerException is thrown when the configuration properties for inline action menus are disabled, resulting in the exception stack trace being logged.

*Resolution:*
The Cúram application has been updated so that when the system administration configuration properties for inline action menus are disabled, a NullPointerException will not be thrown.
