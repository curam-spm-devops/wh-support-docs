SPM-133234,,Users.modify can be a bottleneck during pods warmup,CEF,Application Development Environment,Security Management,Data Access Layer,"*Issue Description:*
When the same user name is used for multiple simultaneous logins, some of the login attempts fail with a RecordChangedException.  

The reason for the error is that each login updates the lastSuccessLoginDate on the Users table and multiple simultaneous logins with the same username may experience contention by trying to update the same Users record.

*User Interface Impact:* No.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the application from multiple browsers with the same username at the same time. 
# Issue: One or more of the login attempts will fail. 

*Resolution:*
For user names listed in application property 'curam.security.default.system.users' the Users record does not get updated during a successful login. The login will still be recorded in the AuthenticationLog table.

(This application property is also used to contain the list of internal system users for which the alternative login mechanism does not get called when 'curam.security.altlogin.enabled' is set to 'True'.)

For a failed login, the Users record will always get updated in order to increment the failed login attempts counter and possibly disable the account. Also for the first successful login after a failed login attempt the Users record will be updated in order to reset the failed login attempts counter to zero.
