# Select Work Queues in the shortcuts panel.
# Navigate through the Work Queues list.
# Issue: The details row toggle button does not provide any information about the particular row it is toggling.

*Resolution:*
The aria-label for the toggle button in the details row in an expandable list now includes additional contextual information, e.g. ?Toggle details, Online Application Received Work Queue, Row 2?. 
*Technical:*
By default, the text from the first column is used to provide additional context for the generated aria-label on the toggle button. In UIM, you can use the CONTEXT element to gain more control over the information included in the aria-label. 
The CONTEXT element can be added as a child of either the FIELD or CONTAINER element, and it supports two attributes: 
*ORDER* -  Indicates that the field should be used to provide additional context for the generated aria-label, and also the concatenation order when generating the aria-label for lists with multiple columns (FIELD elements).
For example, if the first FIELD in the list has ORDER=?2? on its CONTEXT element and the second FIELD  has ORDER=?1?, the generated aria-label will place the text from the second column before the text from the first column.

Semantically related checkbox fields can now be programmatically grouped to provide context to screen reader users. 
*Technical:*
A new attribute called FULL&#95;ROW has been added to Static and Dynamic UIM for CONTAINER elements to support programmatically grouping semantically related checkbox input fields. When checkbox UIM FIELD elements are inside a CONTAINER element with a FULL&#95;ROW attribute set to ?true? and a LABEL attribute specified, a HTML fieldset element with an accompanying legend element will be rendered. The CONTAINER will span the full width of the CLUSTER row, and each child checkbox field will appear in its own column across the cluster row. 
Enabling FULL&#95;ROW =""""true"""" may disrupt the visual layout of the parent CLUSTER (the CONTAINER?s parent), for example, by misaligning fields. To correct this, one or more dummy FIELD elements with the attribute CONTROL=""""SKIP"""" specified can be added inside the CLUSTER but outside the CONTAINER to balance the layout. 
For more information on this new attribute, please see the CONTAINER element documentation in the UIM pages and views reference section in the _Cúram Webclient Reference Manual_. 
Additionally, in static UIM, if a CLUSTER element has a TITLE and only contains FIELD elements which are checkbox input fields, the grouping of checkboxes will be automatically rendered inside a HTML fieldset element with an accompanying legend element. 
For more information on this new attribute, please see the CLUSTER element documentation in the UIM pages and views reference section in the _Cúram Webclient Reference Manual_.

SPM-137903,,Rich Text Editor filter updates,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
The allowlist, which was installed by default, supports a set of HTML elements and attributes which are deemed safe and therefore do not require filtering out. However, it doesn?t provide protocol-level controls, which means customers cannot configure which URL schemes are permitted via the allowlist.
*User Interface Impact:* No
*Resolution:*
We now support protocol entries in the allowlist - for example: 
a.href.protocols=http,https,mailto,tel 
which makes those the only permitted schemes for a[href], with all other protocols filtered out. The SanatizierAllowListConfigure java class was also renamed to SanitizerAllowListConfigure.

SPM-139075,DT037187,LifeEvents and HoldingCaseDP do not have proper error handling mechanism,ENT,Life Event Management,,,"*Issue Description:*
The application does not provide a way for customers to handle errors that occur when an exception is thrown during the deferred process in curam.citizen.datahub.holdingcase.impl.HoldingCaseImpl.updateEvidence(EvidenceUpdate). This results in a lack of error handling for failures during life event updates, making it difficult for customers to implement custom error processing or notify users when a deferred process fails. 
*Steps to Reproduce (Generic):*
Below is a sample scenario where HoldingCaseDP failures are not logged appropriately:
# Log in as a caseworker, register a person and create a Universal Access account for this person.
# Create a new integrated case for the person.
# Log in with the above person?s credentials in the portal and navigate to the Update My Information link.
# Access the Update Income Details life event link and click the Income Details page.
# Add the income details, navigate to the last page, and submit it.
# Log in as a caseworker. 
# Navigate to the integrated case and view the active evidence.
# Verify that added income evidence is not brokered from the Holding Case to the integrated case.
# Check the console log.  
# Issue: The error infrastructure:RUN_ID_RECORD_NOT_FOUND: Record not found seen in the logs. This error doesn?t provide any useful information about the failure. 

*User Interface Impact:* No
*Resolution:*
curam.citizen.datahub.holdingcase.impl.HoldingCaseImpl.updateEvidence(EvidenceUpdate) has been updated to include a new error handler specific to this API. A new hook is now available for customers to implement, which will be invoked when an exception occurs during deferred process execution. 
*Technical:*
An API is provided for customers to define the actions to be taken when an exception occurs. The following method in the hook can be implemented to handle custom error processing: curam.citizen.datahub.holdingcase.impl.HoldingCaseCustomErrorHandler.handleError(String, long).

SPM-139212,DT037198,Entity operations on ProductDeliveryPatternInfo are not translating the name field,CEF,,,,"*Issue Description:*
Entity operations on the ProductDeliveryPatternInfo entity do not correctly translate the name field. When a user selects a different language, the name of the delivery pattern is displayed in English instead of the selected language. This affects multi-locale environments, where users expect to see delivery pattern names in their chosen language.
*User Interface Impact:* No
*Prerequisites:*
# Log in as an administrator.
# Click Product Delivery Cases under Cases in the shortcuts panel.
# Open any product delivery configuration.
# Click Financial and select Delivery Patterns.
# Verify that the delivery pattern ?Weekly by Check in Advance on a Monday? is configured.

# Select French as the language and enter a new translation text, such as ?Weekly by Check in Advance on a Monday_Fr?.

*Steps to Reproduce :*
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Create an instance of the product delivery configured above.## Ensure that ?Weekly by Check in Advance on a Monday? is chosen at the delivery pattern.

# Verify that the selected delivery pattern is displayed in the Home tab and the Financials section.
# Open the User menu and select Language.
# Choose French (Français) and save the selection.
# Verify that the newly added French translation is displayed.
# Repeat steps 5 to 7 for the following languages: German (Deutsch), Spanish (Español), Finnish, Swedish (Svenska), and Arabic (?????).
# Switch the language back to English and confirm that the delivery pattern is displayed in English as the default.
# Issue: The ProductDeliveryPatternInfo.readNearestProdDelPatInfo() entity operation is currently returning the untranslated value of the name field from the ProductDeliveryPatternInfo record.

*Resolution:*
A post method has been added to the ProductDeliveryPatternInfo operations to support the required translation functionality. Entity operations on ProductDeliveryPatternInfo can now correctly translate the name field. 
 If customers require the values for the 'name' column to be localized in their custom environment, they need to ensure that the correct records are inserted into the LocalizableText and TextTranslation tables for that purpose.

# Upon submission, the application will move to a status of ?Awaiting Resolution'. An evidence task related to the evidence issue is created.
# Withdraw the program, which will also result in the closure of the associated application case.
# Issue: The evidence task related to the evidence issue remains open even after the case is automatically closed when the application is withdrawn. 

*Resolution:*
The evidence task related to the evidence issue will be automatically closed when the application case is closed. 
*Technical:*
A new version of the Process Intake Application Workflow has been introduced. Previously, application submission resulted in an error with the ?Mapping?; the application would be set to 'Awaiting Resolution', and an evidence correction task would be created. When the user withdrew the application case, the case would close, but the task would remain open. In the updated new version of the workflow, when the application is closed, the associated task is also closed. This improvement was implemented by adding a new event and an additional step to check the case status and resume based on this. 
Below are the details of the changes:
* The solution introduces a new `Closed` event type in the ApplicationCase.evx file.
* Enhances the Process Intake Application workflow with three new activities: CheckStatus (automatic activity that reads application case status and stores it in the WDO), RouteBasedOnStatus (routes based on case status), and ConvergeStatusBasedRoute (converges to end workflow for closed cases).
* When tasks are manually closed, the workflow now automatically checks the application case status - if closed, it terminates the workflow, preventing case reactivation; if active, it continues normal processing through AESRoute.

This intelligent routing mechanism eliminates orphaned tasks and prevents unintended case reactivation.

*Steps to Reproduce*:
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Click the Care and Protection tab and select Applications.
# Use the New Application Case page-level action to create an instance of the newly configured application case.
# Navigate to the Evidence tab.
# Issue: The first navigation item, which is the Evidence Dashboard, is still being rendered into the content area during the initial tab load, even though the associated nav loader Java logic set it to invisible based on the Evidence Dashboard setting (i.e. false) on the newly configured application case.

*Resolution:*
When the first navigation item in a group is configured as dynamic and marked as hidden, the system immediately detects this state and programmatically triggers a click on the next available visible item. This guarantees that the correct page is displayed in the content area, aligning the UI with the intended navigation configuration and preventing user confusion.

# Issue: When issuing the next payment due on the product delivery, an unhandled server exception is reported by the Generate Instruments batch process.

*Resolution:*
This issue has been addressed and the Generate Instruments batch job no longer reports an unhandled server exception when future payments are transferred to a new bank account for a representative. The issue arose as there were two Case Nominee Destination records for the nominee (representative), one active and one cancelled, but the logic inside Generate Instruments to check if a valid bank account existed, did not perform a read on status. This existing entity read has been replaced by one that only looks for active Case Nominee Destination records.

SPM-145804,DT037359,The household calculation is incorrect for a second pregnancy,SOL,Income Support HCR,Eligibility & Entitlement,,"*Issue Description:*
The household size calculation for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility was incorrect when multiple pregnancy records existed for the same person. The system only considered the first pregnancy record, resulting in an inaccurate household member count during postpartum periods and when new pregnancies were added. This led to incorrect eligibility determinations for both Streamlined Medicaid and CHIP programs.
*User Interface Impact:* No
*Steps to Reproduce: *
*Scenario 1: Streamlined Medicaid*
# Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
# Register a female person.
# Submit an Insurance Affordability Application with Application Date as Jan 1 of the current year, select Pregnant as yes with 3 children expected, enter Due Date as <Upcoming date within the current year>, set income as none, and submit.
# Apply all evidence and authorize to create a Streamlined Medicaid and Insurance Affordability case.
# Open the Streamlined Medicaid product delivery, click Determinations, and observe that 3 entries for Pregnancy, Post-Partum, and Adult categories.
# Open the Pregnancy evidence, remove the Due Date, set the Received Date, and Pregnancy End Date to <any date before the due date>. Save and apply the evidence changes.
# Refresh Streamlined Medicaid. Four coverage period entries will appear.
# Return to Pregnancy evidence and add a new record with Received Date and Start Date as <Start date for second pregnancy>, Due Date as <Due date for second pregnancy>, and unborn children as 1. Apply the evidence changes.
# Issue: Access the Streamlined Medicaid case and navigate to the Determinations section. Only three entries are displayed. The entry for the second pregnancy incorrectly reflects just one household member, instead of including two household members.

*Scenario 2: CHIP Eligibility And Entitlement*
# Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
# Register a female person, age 18.
# Submit an Insurance Affordability Application with Application Date as Jan 1 of the current year, mark Pregnant as Yes with 3 children expected, enter Due Date as <Upcoming date within the current year>, select Taxpayer as Yes, add income as $42,000/year, and submit the application.
# Apply all evidence and authorize to create HCR CHIP, Insurance Assistance, and Insurance Affordability cases.
# Access the HCR CHIP link, click Determinations, and verify that two entries are created: one Eligible (with coverage cost) and the other Not Eligible (no household members found eligible).
# Navigate back to the Evidence tab on the Insurance Affordability case and open the Pregnancy evidence in a separate tab.
# Click the Edit link, remove the Due Date, update the Received Date and Pregnancy End Date to <any date before the due date>, then save and apply the evidence change.
# Go back to Pregnancy evidence and add new evidence with Received Date and Start Date as <Start date for second pregnancy>, Due Date as <Due date for second pregnancy>, and Unborn children as 4. Apply the evidence changes.
# Issue: In the HCR CHIP Determinations section, three entries are displayed, but the determination for the second pregnancy is incorrectly shown as Not Eligible.

*Resolution:*
StreamlineMedicaidEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml  and CHIPEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml rules have been updated to handle multiple pregnancy records. The system now accurately includes all applicable household members in the determination, reflecting the correct household size for the second pregnancy. 
The following ruleset files have been modified: 
1) EJBServer/components/HCR/CREOLE&#95;Rule&#95;Sets/StreamlineMedicaidEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml 
2) EJBServer/components/HCR/CREOLE&#95;Rule&#95;Sets/CHIPEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml 
 The following attributes were modified as part of the fix: 
1) EJBServer/components/HCR/CREOLE&#95;Rule&#95;Sets/StreamlineMedicaidEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml 
* medicaidFamilySize(attribute modified) 

2) EJBServer/components/HCR/CREOLE&#95;Rule&#95;Sets/CHIPEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml 
* medicaidFamilySize(attribute modified) 

*Technical:*
The StreamlineMedicaidEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml and CHIPEligibilityAndEntitlementRuleset.xml rulesets have been updated to properly handle multiple pregnancy evidences for the medicaidFamilySize attribute. Both rule-sets now incorporate improved household calculation logic that properly sums unborn children from all pregnancies. This ensures accurate family size calculations across all pregnancy records, providing more precise eligibility and entitlement determinations for both Medicaid and CHIP programs.

SPM-146515,,File Downloads via REST API may now require Accept header after Jackson JAX-RS Provider Upgrade,Third Party Updates,,,,"*Issue Description:*
Following the upgrade to the Jackson JARs from version 2.15.2 to 2.19.2, an error is being thrown when making REST API calls for file downloads that contain binary data (Blob objects).
*User Interface Impact:* No
*Steps to Reproduce:*
# Upload a blob file (like an image) via a File Upload API e.g. {{/v1/dbs/files}}
# Attempt to get File Contents via API e.g. {{/v1/dbs/files/:fileId}} without specifying an Accept header
# Issue: An InvalidDefinitionException is thrown: {{InvalidDefinitionException: No serializer found for class curam.util.type.Blob}}

*Resolution:*
Ensure the correct {{Accept}} header is provided for API calls when downloading binary files:
{noformat}GET /v1/dbs/files/:fileId
Accept: application/octet-stream{noformat}

*JavaScript/Fetch API:*
{noformat}fetch('/v1/dbs/files/123', {  
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/octet-stream'
  }
}){noformat}

*cURL:*
{noformat}curl -H """"Accept: application/octet-stream"""" /v1/dbs/files/123{noformat}

*Java HTTP Client:*
{noformat}HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create(""""/v1/dbs/files/123""""))
    .header(""""Accept"""", """"application/octet-stream"""")
    .build();{noformat}"

SPM-148166,,"When the 'Enable Localized Currency Symbol Placement' property is set to false, numerical amounts are converted to the Arabic locale in the Modern Java build",Look and Feel,,,Infrastructure,"*Issue Description:*
Modern Java is configured by default to use the Common Data Local Repository (CDLR) for the formatting and processing of locale-dependent values. [https://openjdk.org/jeps/252] describes this support. It is a more robust and correct handling of dates, times, currencies, languages, countries, and time zones based on locale compared to the previous default native handling in Java 8. Visually, the update represents changes in how values are formatted and presented in the User Interface. 
Example: for locale=ar, values containing digits will be shown as Arabic-Indic digits, not Latin-based digits as was previously the case.
*User Interface Impact:* No"

SPM-148525,DT037430,Insufficient documentation on parameters for improving batch performance,Product Documentation,,,,"*Issue Description:*
Currently, there is insufficient documentation on the parameters used in streamed batch processes, which prevents customers from fine-tuning performance when batch processes fail to complete within the expected timeframe. The parameters in question are:
# curam.batch.streams.batchprocessreadwaitinterval
# curam.batch.streams.chunkkeyreadwaitinterval
# curam.batch.streams.scanforunprocessedchunkswaitinterval 
# *.unprocessedchunkwaitinterval

*User Interface Impact:* No
*Steps to Reproduce:*
# Schedule and run a streamed batch process.
# Issue: If chunks are not completing within 1?2 minutes, what configuration settings can customers adjust to improve performance?

*Resolution:*
The _Curam Batch Performance Mechanism_ guide has been updated to include additional information on the four batch parameters listed above.
