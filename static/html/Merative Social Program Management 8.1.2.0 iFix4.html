Specifically, the database incorrectly applies a 1-hour daylight saving time (DST) adjustment at midnight on that date. As a result, the date is shifted back to May 2, 1942 during calculations, leading to inaccurate historical date handling.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Add “-Duser.timezone=America/Puerto_Rico” to the Default VM Arguments for the JRE being used.<li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a person with their date of birth as May 3, 1942.<li>Issue: Their date of birth is incorrectly displayed as May 2, 1942.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>A special case has been added to handle this anomaly and ensure accurate date calculations.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-143970"></a>DT036603, WorkItem:SPM-143970 - Specific task types are not closed automatically by the application after incoming evidence issues have been resolved<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>The following three problematic scenarios relating to tasks have been raised:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: 'No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval' task could be closed off manually even without a supervisor available. <br/><br/>Scenario 2: 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task does not close automatically when incoming evidence is resolved.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' task can not be manually closed when in-edit evidence is resolved.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><br/><b>Scenario 1:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a new person.<li>Create an integrated case.<li>Create a product delivery case.<li>Update the Position and PositionReportingLink database tables as follows. This removes supervisors from the organizational structure.<ol><li>UPDATE POSITION SET LEADPOSITIONIND = '0'<li>UPDATE POSITIONREPORTINGLINK SET RECORDSTATUS = 'RST2'</ol><li>Submit the product delivery for approval.<li>Navigate to the tasks tab on the product delivery.<li>Click the task ‘No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval.’<li>On the task home page, select 'Confirm that the supervisor exists'.<li>Click Yes on the dialog box to confirm.<li>Issue: The task gets closed without the supervisor present.</ol><b>Scenario 2:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as an administrator.<li>Select Evidence Sharing within Rules and Evidence on the shortcuts panel.<li>Create an identical evidence-sharing configuration from one integrated case type to another integrated case type.<li>Set Trusted Source = No.<li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a new person.<li>Create two integrated cases for the registered person, i.e. the types configured for sharing in the previous step.<li>On the first case, navigate to the evidence tab.<li>Add evidence and apply evidence changes.<li>On the second case, a 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task is created within the Tasks tab.<li>Navigate to the Evidences tab and select incoming evidence.<li>Resolve the incoming evidence by adding it to the case.<li> Issue: The task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' is not closed even after the incoming evidence is resolved.</ol><b>Scenario 3:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a new person.<li>Submit an application.<li>On the application case, delete some evidence that would trigger mandatory evidence validations on the related integrated case.<li>Authorize the application case.<li>On the integrated case that gets created, evidence failed to activate and a new task 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' is created within the Tasks tab.<li>Navigate to the evidence tab and apply changes to activate the evidence on the integrated case.<li>A validation error for the mandatory evidence is displayed.<li>Add the missing evidence and apply evidence changes. <li>Open the task and click ‘Add To My Tasks’.<li>Now click Close on the task.<li>Issue: An error message appears preventing the task from being closed: ‘Task XXX cannot be closed from this page.’</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>Scenario 1: Validations have been included to confirm that a supervisor exists before the task gets closed.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: This issue has been resolved and the task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' gets closed when all the incoming evidence is resolved.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: It is now possible to manually close the task. A new version of the AdvancedEvidenceSharingInEditTask workflow has been added to facilitate this manual closure.<br/><br/><b>Upgrade Impact:</b><br/>For Scenario 3, any existing in-progress tasks will be created using the old workflow version. These tasks will not be affected by the new workflow, and a caseworker will still not be able to manually close them. Once the new workflow version is released and deployed, new tasks will be created, and a caseworker will be able to manually close them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></p>
