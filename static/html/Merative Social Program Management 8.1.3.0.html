Currently, the field labels are only visible via tooltips, which are visible only when hovering over an input field with a mouse or trackpad. This is an accessibility issue, as not all users navigate the page with a mouse or a trackpad. Many users rely on a keyboard for navigation or use mobile devices, so these users cannot easily determine what each field represents.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as an administrator.<li>Select New User below Users in the shortcuts panel.<li>Navigate to the Business Phone Number field in the Contact section.<li>Using a mouse or trackpad, hover over each input field to reveal a tooltip containing the field label.<li>Now navigate through each input field of the Business Phone Number using a keyboard.<li>Issue: No tooltip is visible when navigating these fields using a keyboard.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The labels for the individual input fields that make up a phone or fax number are now visibly displayed on the page. <br/><br/><b>Technical:</b><br/>A new UIM attribute called SHOW&#95;LABELS has been added for CONTAINER elements to support this for phone or fax number input fields. The SHOW&#95;LABELS attribute default value is ‘false’, so SHOW&#95;LABELS="true" must be set on the phone or fax number CONTAINER element to display the input field labels if LABEL attributes have been configured for the CONTAINER's child FIELD elements.<br/><br/>For more information on this new attribute, please see the CONTAINER element documentation in the UIM pages and views reference section in the <i>Cúram Webclient Reference Manual</i>.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

During the migration of PDCAddress evidence, the value of the ‘address’ field in the DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute table is incorrectly copied. This field serves as a foreign key to an Address entity.

This can prevent large chunk sizes from being utilized. Part of this memory demand is caused by two transaction-level caches: the SQL Query cache and the Persistence Infrastructure (PI) cache, whose sizes increase over the duration of a chunk.<br/><br/>It is now possible to enable either or both of these transaction-level caches to be cleared at the end of processing each case in the chunk instead of waiting for the end of the chunk, thereby stopping the memory demand from increasing proportionally to the size of the chunk. The property name takes the format 'curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.&lt;instanceID>' where &lt;instanceID> identifies a type of chunked batch program.<br/><br/>Valid values of &lt;instanceID> can be found in the code table 'Batch Process Chunk Name'. Valid values for this property are as follows:<br/><br/>0 - Cache clearing off (i.e. the transaction-level caches will be cleared at the end of the chunk).<br/>1 - Clear the  PI cache at the end of processing each case.<br/>2 - Clear SQL Query cache at the end of processing each case.<br/>3 - Clear both caches at the end of processing each case. <br/><br/><b>Example 1:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>To clear both caches per case for 'CREOLE Bulk Case Chunk Reassessment by Product':  curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.BPN6=3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/><b>Example 2:</b><br/>To clear only the PI cache per case for 'Generate Instruction Line Items':  curam.batch.streams.cache.clear.mode.BPN1=1.<br/><br/><i>As with all caches, there is a trade-off between memory usage and fetching data from the database. Although clearing a cache more frequently will lessen the memory demand, it will also require some data to be reloaded more frequently. The overall gain or loss will be dependent on the content of the data being processed.</i><br/><br/>Note that since this is an optional property for out-of-the-box and custom chunked batch programs it is not automatically available in the Property Administration screen. To use this property for a chunked batch program you must first add it by clicking the New button in the Property Administration screen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Property Name:</b> Cache CER rates per transaction<br/><b>Technical ID:</b> curam.cache.cer.rate<br/><b>Category:</b> Application - Cache settings<br/><b>Type:</b> Boolean<br/><b>Default value:</b> false<br/><br/>By default, CER rates are included in the PI cache for the duration of a transaction. If the PI cache gets cleared at the end of each case during a chunk, rates must be re-read from the database more often. To mitigate the performance overhead in re-reading CER rates during a transaction, a separate transaction-level cache for CER rates can be enabled by setting this property to True.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Property Name:</b> Enable transaction-level cache for query CaseNomineeProdDelPattern.readByEffectiveDate<br/><b>Technical ID</b>: curam.casenomineeproddelpattern.readbyeffectivedate.cache<br/><b>Category:</b> Application - Cache settings<br/><b>Type:</b> Boolean<br/><b>Default value:</b> false<br/><br/>When reassessing long-lived cases, for example, above ten years, on which payments have been issued, the table CaseNomineeProdDelPattern is queried very heavily for each past payment period on which payment could have been made for the case. This is especially evident when reassessing cases after applying a rate change. The entity operation is 'CaseNomineeProdDelPattern.readByEffectiveDate', and the SQL for the query is: <br/><br/>SELECT CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERNID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.FROMDATE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.PRODUCTDELIVERYPATTERNID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEID, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.STATUSCODE, CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.VERSIONNO FROM CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN WHERE CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.CASENOMINEEID= ? AND CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.STATUSCODE= ? AND ( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.FROMDATE &lt;= ? ) AND (( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE>= ? ) OR ( CASENOMINEEPRODDELPATTERN.TODATE IS NULL) )<br/><br/>This can place a large processing load on the database. To mitigate this processing load, it is now possible to optionally consolidate the multiple queries on table CaseNomineeProdDelPattern into a single query per case per transaction by setting this property to True.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Property Name:</b> Batch Chunk Record Insert/Delete Commit Size<br/><b>Technical ID:</b> curam.batch.chunker.recordinsertdeletecommitsize<br/><b>Category:</b> Application - Batch settings<br/><b>Type:</b> 32 bit Integer<br/><b>Default value:</b> 10000000<br/><br/>By default, chunked batch programs use a single transaction to insert the chunk records at the start, and another single transaction to delete them at the end. For batch jobs with a very large number of chunks, these large transactions can consume excessive transaction log space in the database. This property allows you to specify a maximum number of chunk records per transaction at both the start and end of a chunked batch run. If the number of chunks exceeds this value, the inserts and deletes will be executed in a series of smaller transactions.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

This can be installed as an optional component by selecting the ‘IE-V&#95;Eligibility’ component in the Child Welfare Installer and enabled by setting the ‘curam.cfss.iveeligibility.enabled’ application property to true. This results in the display of an IV-E Eligibility tab in the Ongoing Case.<br/><br/>The IV-E component includes a sample Classic rule set and a set of evidence to demonstrate how Title IV-E eligibility can be determined. The sample rules execute against evidence such as the child’s age, deprivation, citizenship status, and home removal information to assess the child's IV-E eligibility.<br/><br/>Some UIM and property files, which were originally located in the ‘CFSS\webclient\components\ChildServices\Fostercare\Removal’ directory but had been duplicated in the ‘CFSS\webclient\components\IVEEligibility\Overridden\Child Services\Fostercare\Removal’ directory, have been removed.

<h4>Third Party Updates</h4>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-105751"></a>WorkItem:SPM-105751 - Upgrade to the latest version of the H2 database<br/><p>H2 is the Java SQL database. The main features of H2 are that it is fast, open source and contains embedded and server modes in-memory databases It also has a browser-based console application and a relatively small footprint. H2 is only supported for use in the Cúram development environment to aid application design, development and testing. H2 is not supported for use with IBM Websphere Application Server or Oracle WebLogic Server.<br/><br/>The version of H2 delivered with Cúram has been updated from 1.3.176 to 2.2.224. A significant number of enhancements and defect fixes are present between these two versions of H2. Please refer to <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html">https://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html</a> for further details on these.<br/><br/>As a result of this upgrade, the following changes have been made in the Java Development Environment deliverable.<br/><br/><ul><li>CuramSDEJ/lib/third&#95;party&#95;version.properties - the version of H2 has been updated.<li>CuramSDEJ\drivers\h2-2.2.224.jar - the version of H2 has been updated.</ul>We recommend that you update any references in custom scripts and other artefacts to point to the new version of H2 that is specified above.<br/><br/>As well as the updates specified above, several other changes have been made in conjunction with this update.<br/><ol><li>The connection setting of MCVCC has been discontinued in this updated version of H2. As a result, the following H2-related property, ‘curam.db.h2.mvcc’ which could have been specified in the Bootstrap.properties file has been removed. All references in the documentation to this property have also been removed.<li>The new version of the H2 driver disallows H2 reserved words from being used as database table names, column names and in handcrafted SQL syntax. This has resulted in the introduction of a new property, ‘curam.db.h2.non.keywords’, which may be used in the Bootstrap.properties to define keywords specified in custom logic which should be ignored by the H2 driver when performing this check. <li>When performing the OOTB build database command for H2, the command generated for dropping tables now contains the keyword ‘CASCADE’ to ensure all dependent tables are also dropped and errors do not present as a result of foreign key constraints between tables.<li>The data type defined for SVR&#95;STRING&#95;SMALL for H2 was defined as a CHARACTER. The new version of H2 was padding out data for these columns with extra spaces which was causing some searches to fail when using H2. The data type for SVR&#95;STRING&#95;SMALL in H2 is now defined as a VARCHAR to alleviate this issue. <li>The function to obtain the current date and time in the DDL generated for H2 has been changed from ‘CURRENT TIMESTAMP’ to ‘CURRENT&#95;TIMESTAMP’.<li>The function to obtain the current date in the DDL generated for H2 has been changed from has been changed from ‘CURRENT DATE’ to ‘CURRENT&#95;DATE’.<li>It is recommended that H2 databases built with the previous version of the driver be removed and new instances rebuilt with the new version of the driver. <li>If a failure is encountered attempting to create a database in ‘remote’ mode, the ‘-ifNotExists’ flag may be added to your custom H2 start command if required. This must be done as the default for H2 is now not to auto-create databases when run in standalone network mode.</ol><br/><br/></p></p>

<a name="deprecation"></a><h2>Notes on Deprecation</h2><a name="Deprecation"></a><a name=""></a>
This section describes artifacts that are deprecated in this release and the functionality that supersedes them.<p/>

Enhancements or defect fixes might require the contract of a development artifact to be changed. In this context, the contract of an artifact is its API or signature, for example, name, parameters, return values, and its documented statement of functionality, for example, Javadoc.<p/>

In these cases, deprecation is used to reduce the impact of the change on custom applications. The original artifact is preserved and marked as 'deprecated' to indicate that it has been superseded by other functionality (often a new artifact). Infrastructure is provided to assist you in identifying custom dependencies on these deprecated artifacts. Deprecation can affect customizations in a number of different ways and has some implications for customer support. For more information about deprecation, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Server Developer's Guide. This chapter describes what deprecation is, how it can affect custom code, what it means for support and the build infrastructure that helps pinpoint custom artifact dependencies on deprecated artifacts.<p/>

You can find out whether your code is affected by any of the following deprecations (and precisely where) by running the deprecationreport build target. If that build produces deprecation warnings, then you are affected by one or more of the deprecated artifacts that are itemized. For more information about using the build target and analyzing its output, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Server Developer's Guide.
