<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-126035"></a>DT036349, WorkItem:SPM-126035 - External login mechanism called incorrectly for internal system users like SYSTEM, WEBSVCS, and Public Citizen<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>The system property 'curam.security.altlogin.enabled' allows an external authentication system to be used. When this property is enabled, the external login mechanism PublicAccessSecurity.getRegisteredUsername is called for all users, including internal system users such as SYSTEM, and WEBSVCS. This behavior is incorrect. The external login mechanism should not be called for internal system users.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Prerequisites:</b><br/><ol><li>Set the 'curam.security.altlogin.enabled' property to true.<li>Implement a class that extends the core class 'curam.core.sl.impl.PublicAccessSecurity'.<li>Update the property 'curam.custom.externalaccess.implementation' to point to the new class. </ol><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in to the application as an internal user and observe the execution in the new class. <li>Issue: The external login implementation class is called for internal users. </ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>This is now resolved by adding a check that prevents the call to the alternative login mechanism for a configured set of internal system users. A list of the names for these users is defined in a new system property 'curam.security.default.system.users'.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>
