<h3>Verify Download Integrity (SHA-256 Checksums)</h3>
<p>To ensure the integrity of your downloaded files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the file(s) from the links provided above.</li>
<li>Generate the SHA-256 checksum for the downloaded file using a tool such as shasum or certutil. For example:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>On Linux, run shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt; in the Terminal.</li>
    <li>On Windows, run certutil -hashfile &lt;filename&gt; SHA256 in the Command Prompt.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Compare the generated checksum with the corresponding value in the table below.</li>
<li>If the checksums match exactly, the file is authentic and has not been tampered with.</li>

Invalid and confusing text is announced when navigating through the dashboard, and interactive elements such as the expand/collapse buttons and filter buttons do not function as expected. Additionally, their status is not accurately reflected to the screen reader user. The labels for these interactive elements are also not unique, which may confuse the screen reader user. Furthermore, users must hover over an evidence row with a mouse or tab to it using a keyboard to reveal the button to create a new piece of evidence.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> Yes<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a new Person.<li>Create an integrated case for the person and navigate to the Evidence tab, where the Evidence Dashboard can be found.<li>Enable a screen reader and navigate through the dashboard.<li>Interact with the dashboard by expanding and collapsing the panels, using the filter buttons and creating new evidence.<li>Issue: Confusing and invalid text is announced, and interactive elements do not function as expected, which makes it difficult for screen reader users to navigate and interact with the dashboard.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The Evidence Dashboard has been updated to ensure that clear and concise text is announced to screen reader users when navigating through the dashboard. Interactive elements, such as the expand/collapse and filter buttons, now function correctly. The button to create a new piece of evidence is now revealed by default and no longer requires user interaction to display.<br/><br/>Additionally, unique labels have been provided for all interactive elements, and their programmatic status is accurately updated. This ensures that screen reader users receive full context for the current element. To support this, four message entries in the related curam.message.EVIDENCEDASHBOARD message file have been deprecated. New message file entries have been added, allowing arguments to be inserted into the messages to provide context to screen reader users regarding the current element.<br/><br/><br/></p></p><p>Artefacts were deprecated as a result of this change.

While sighted users can easily view both elements simultaneously, screen reader users must navigate further down the page to access the case status information. This status is announced without any additional context, which can lead to confusion, as there is no explanation of what ‘Open’ or ‘Disposed’, etc., refers to.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> Yes<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Enable a screen reader.<li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a person and create an application.<li>Navigate to the application context panel.<li>Issue: Screen reader users must navigate past other content to locate the status, as it is positioned separately from the reference number and is announced without descriptive context.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The application name, reference number, and status are now grouped together in the context panel.

<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-135787"></a>DT037032, WorkItem:SPM-135787 - Focus is not visible when navigating filtered values in a combobox at 200% zoom <br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>When navigating filtered lists with a zoom level of 200%, the keyboard focus is not visible if the focused item is outside the current view. The list does not automatically scroll to bring the focused value into view, making it difficult for users to track their position within the list.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Navigate to the ‘Register Person and Create Case’ link under the Cases section in the shortcuts panel.<li>In the ‘Register Person and Create Case’ dialog, zoom the browser to 200%.<li>Navigate to the Type drop-down and type the letter ‘a’.

Additionally, the list does not scroll automatically to bring the focused item into view.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>As users navigate through the filtered list, the component now ensures that the focused value is automatically scrolled into view if it is not currently visible. This guarantees that the focused item remains visible even at 200% zoom.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

While sighted users can easily view both elements simultaneously, screen reader users must navigate further down the page to access the case status. This status is announced without any descriptive context, which can confuse a caseworker. For example, terms like ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’ are read aloud without indicating what they refer to.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> Yes<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Enable a screen reader.<li>Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.<li>Register a new person.<li>Add the necessary evidence to make the associated product delivery eligible.<li>Authorize the application case.<li>Navigate to the product delivery case.<li>Issue: Screen reader users must navigate past other content to locate the case status, which is positioned separately from the case name or reference number in the context panel and announced without context.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The case name, reference number, and status are now grouped in the context panel. A hidden label for screen readers is announced before the case status. As a result, when users navigate to this section, the screen reader now announces the case name, reference number, status label, and status value together, providing clear, contextual information.<br/><br/>The changes to the context panel layout may introduce a scrollbar to accommodate all panel content.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

<a name="deprecation"></a><h2>Notes on Deprecation</h2><a name="Deprecation"></a><a name=""></a>
This section describes artifacts that are deprecated in this release and the functionality that supersedes them.<p/>

Enhancements or defect fixes might require the contract of a development artifact to be changed. In this context, the contract of an artifact is its API or signature, for example, name, parameters, return values, and its documented statement of functionality, for example, Javadoc.<p/>

In these cases, deprecation is used to reduce the impact of the change on custom applications. The original artifact is preserved and marked as 'deprecated' to indicate that it has been superseded by other functionality (often a new artifact). Infrastructure is provided to assist you in identifying custom dependencies on these deprecated artifacts. Deprecation can affect customizations in a number of different ways and has some implications for customer support. For more information about deprecation, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Server Developer's Guide. This chapter describes what deprecation is, how it can affect custom code, what it means for support and the build infrastructure that helps pinpoint custom artifact dependencies on deprecated artifacts.<p/>

You can find out whether your code is affected by any of the following deprecations (and precisely where) by running the deprecationreport build target. If that build produces deprecation warnings, then you are affected by one or more of the deprecated artifacts that are itemized. For more information about using the build target and analyzing its output, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Server Developer's Guide.

The java.locale.providers property is supported in Java 21 but is due to expire in Java23.</p></p>
