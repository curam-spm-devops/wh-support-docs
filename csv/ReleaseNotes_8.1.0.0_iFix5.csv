*Resolution:*
The CSS for all screens containing action menus which are contained within nested lists have been adjusted to ensure that there is a minimum amount of space in those containing action menus that need to expand downwards. This will help with readability and will ensure that action menus contained within nested lists display a greater number of values that will result in less need for scrolling by users.
