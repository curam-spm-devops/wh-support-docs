SPM-144457,DT037316,DBtoJMS LTPA mode does not handle http content length specifier correctly,CEF,Technical Services,,,"*Issue Description:*
Batch jobs which were using the DBtoJMS functionality were incorrectly processing the response content length figure by treating it as a decimal string whereas it is actually represented as a hexadecimal string.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:* 

Set the following application properties:

* curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.enabled = True
* curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.port = Application Server specific
* curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.ltpa = True
* curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.trace = True

Run the following SQL statements:

* UPDATE KeyServer SET humanReadable = '1' WHERE keysetCode = 'DEFAULT';
* UPDATE KeyServer SET nextUniqueIDBlock=400000000 WHERE keysetCode = 'DEFAULT';

Restart server.

Issue: Run the batch launcher. A numberFormat exception is thrown.

The defect has been fixed, eliminating the numberFormat exception and allowing the batch job to complete successfully. "
