SPM-143563,,The 'configtest' target fails when run against a Db2 for z/OS version 13 database,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"The ?build configtest? target was failing when run against Db2 for z/OS database version 13. This was due to the version of the database being incorrectly specified in the associated ?CuramSDEJlibthird_party&#95;tools&#95;version.properties? file.

This has now been resolved, and the version of Db2 for z/OS specified in this file has been updated to 13.1.

"
SPM-143534,,Cúram Installer process improvements,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Change*
The Cúram post-installation process has been improved.
The aim is to allow customers to generate a new secret key and keystore for enhanced security and to encrypt Cúram passwords using the key. 

*Use*
The key in the keystore is a symmetric key used for Advanced Encryption Standard encryption. 
This key is utilized to encrypt and decrypt configuration passwords, including those for the database and web services. 

*New Ant targets*
A new Ant target is provided to either create a new keystore or reuse an existing one: ?createkeystore?.
A new Ant target is added to initialise some credentials required for use in Cúram: 'init_passwords'.

*What new targets are used for?*
These are used to generate a new encryption key and set up credentials such as for database connectivity, the application server and some out-of-the-box users. 

*Required action*
The target ?init_passwords? can be run in an interactive or automated mode. 
In interactive mode, it will prompt to provide the username and/or password for the required credentials.
In automated mode, it requires each credential to be specified for update.
The credentials set by ?init_passwords? will be encrypted or digested appropriately using the settings in CryptoConfig.properties and written to the corresponding source files.

*For more detailed information*
See the _Cúram Development Environment Installation Guide 8.2_ updates for more details.

SPM-143378,,Customise users in LoginClient,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
The RMILoginClient used to log in to the server previously provided the means to quickly login for a fixed set of users. This has been enhanced to allow customisation of the users able to quickly login.

The same change applies to the RestLoginClient in Cúram for Modern Java.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Resolution:*
The RMILoginClient (or RestLoginClient under Modern Java) now allows customisation of the quick login buttons by reading usernames and passwords from a properties file on the classpath. 

A default set of users are provided with quick login buttons. If you wish to change the users available to quick login, add a file to the classpath called 'LoginClient.properties' and add usernames (and optionally passwords) as per this example:

username1=password   &#35; internal user
internal.username2=   &#35; internal user (without password)
external.username3=password  &#35; external user

SPM-142775,DT037279,Date anomaly for May 3rd 1942 in timezone America/Puerto_Rico,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
The date May 3, 1942 is misinterpreted in the America/Puerto_Rico timezone due to an anomaly in certain versions of the Java timezone database. Specifically, the database incorrectly applies a 1-hour daylight saving time (DST) adjustment at midnight on that date. As a result, the date is shifted back to May 2, 1942 during calculations, leading to inaccurate historical date handling.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Add ?-Duser.timezone=America/Puerto_Rico? to the Default VM Arguments for the JRE being used.
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a person with their date of birth as the 3rd of May 1942.
# Issue: Their date of birth is displayed as the 2nd of May 1942.

*Resolution:*
A special case has been added to handle this anomaly and ensure accurate date calculations.

SPM-142681,,LifeEvents and HoldingCaseDP do not have proper error handling mechanism,CEF,Life Event Management,,,"*Issue Description:*
Developers were unable to throw AppException and InformationalException messages from the curam.citizen.datahub.impl.CustomUpdateProcessor.processUpdate() API, as the method signature did not declare these exceptions.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Resolution:*
The processUpdate() API method signature has been revised to throw AppException and InformationalException messages, thereby allowing developers to raise these exceptions when necessary.

SPM-141158,DT037250,Dependency Manager reassesses cases immediately after activation,CEF,Integrated Case Management,Eligibility & Entitlement,Cúram Express Rules,"*Issue Description:*
When a case is activated either online or by the DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility batch job the next execution of the dependency manager causes the case to be reassessed.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce (Generic):*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Add an integrated case for the person.
# Add the necessary evidence to make the person eligible.
# Activate the evidence.
# Create a product delivery for a person.
# Submit it for approval.
# Activate the case by either
#* Queue and run the DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility batch program or
#* Use the Activate Online menu.
# Check the case in the browser; its status will be Active, it will have a current determination, and the determination history will show one reassessment.
# If the case was activated by the DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility, now run the dependency manager batch suite.
# Check the case in the browser.
# Issue: The current determination for the case will show a more recent timestamp. Also, the DependencyTrace table will show 2 REASSESS records for the case. This is because activating the case changes its status to 'Active', which creates a PrecedentChangeItem (PCI) for the case header. This PCI causes the Dependency Manager to reassess the case unnecessarily.

*Resolution:*
Activating a case no longer creates a PCI for the PDCS case header while assessing the case for the first time during activation. Hence, the Dependency Manager no longer reassesses the case. This applies to cases which are activated online or by the DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility batch program.

If required, this behaviour can be suppressed by setting the application property ?curam.ruleobjectpropagation.disable.casestatus.filter? to ?True?, in which case the above PCI will be created during case activation. "

SPM-140845,,Validation message 'Bank account type of the shared account does not match the bank account type entered' is not being consistently applied across all participants linked to a joint bank account,CEF,Dynamic Evidence,Dynamic Evidence,,"*Issue Description:*
If a joint bank account which has been added to a person is being added to another person, a validation should be thrown if the bank account type specified for the second person is different to that specified for the first person. The validation should read, ?Bank account type of the shared account does not match the bank account type entered.?

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person (Person 1).
# Register a second Person (Person 2).
# Add a bank account to Person 1 with details:
## Account Name: Test Account
## Account Type: Personal Current
## Account Number: 11112222
## Sort Code: 90-14-87
## From: 1/1/2025

## Account Name: Test Account
## Account Type: Personal Deposit
## Account Number: 11112222
## Sort Code: 90-14-87
## From: 1/1/2025
## Joint = true
# Issue: No validation is thrown to inform the caseworker that the bank account type specified for Person 2 differs from that of Person 1. Since both individuals are sharing the same joint bank account, the account type must be the same.

*Resolution:*
An existing validation has been included to ensure consistency in account types when adding a joint bank account for multiple participants. If a joint account already associated with one person is added to another person using a different account type, the following message is displayed to the caseworker 'Bank account type of the shared account does not match the bank account type entered.?

In the SQL queries which are generated dynamically for accessing evidence during rules calculations, each column is qualified with its containing table name, which is unnecessary, and each query includes an ORDER BY clause, which is not always necessary.

*User Interface Impact:* No.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a system administrator.
# Enable SQL tracing for the application by setting the application property 'curam.trace.sql' to 'True'.
# Publish the property changes.

# Register a new Person.
# Add an integrated case for the person.

The server log file will contain queries like the following:

?SELECT CASEHEADER.APPEALINDICATOR , CASEHEADER.CASEID ,..., CASEHEADER.VERSIONNO FROM CASEHEADER WHERE CASEID= 12345678 ORDER BY CASEID WITH CS?

It is not necessary to qualify each field with the table name 'CASEHEADER' because CASEHEADER is the only table referenced by the query.
It is not necessary to specify 'ORDER BY CASEID' because CASEID is the primary key, so the query can return a maximum of one record.
This increases the communication and processing workload of the database.

*Resolution:*
Dynamically generated SQL queries no longer qualify each attribute name and, when the search clause is the primary key, do not specify an ORDER BY clause.
The query in the above example would now look like the following:

 ?SELECT APPEALINDICATOR, CASEID,..., VERSIONNO FROM CASEHEADER WHERE CASEID= 12345678?

XMLServer does not function with the version of WebSphere Liberty (24.0.0.9) and WebSphere Version 9.0.5.21 and upwards.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Deploy the Cúram application in WebSphere Liberty 24.0.0.9 or IBM WebSphere 9.0.5.21
# Use the XMLServer to generate a PDF document.
# Issue: An error is displayed on the client screen, and the server log files will contain a message ?SSL HANDSHAKE FAILURE?. E.g.:

  CWPKI0824E: SSL HANDSHAKE FAILURE: Hostname verification error while connecting to host [127.0.0.1].
  The hostname used to access the server does not match the server certificate's [Subject Alternative Name []].
  The extended error message from the SSL handshake exception is: [No subject alternative names present].

The reason is that when IBM WebSphere or WebSphere Liberty is acting as a client connecting to an outbound server, the runtime now checks to make sure that the hostname or IP address from the server certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) matches the hostname or IP address used when establishing the connection.

*Resolution:*
A new property 'san.name' has been added to TLSKeystore.properties to specify the SAN information to be included in the XML Server certificate. The default value of this property is 'san.name='dns:xmlserver,dns:localhost'. For more details, see the section 'Securing the XML server' in the _Cúram XML Infrastructure Guide_.

SPM-138370,DT037145,The placeholder text that prompts a user for the correct date format is not translated,Look and Feel,Common Intake,,,"*Issue Description:*
The placeholder text that prompts a user for the correct date format is not translated within the date input field.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

a. On the register person modal.

# Log in as an administrator.
# Search for the caseworker user.
# Change the user locale to a non-English locale.
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Select the Register Person link from the shortcuts panel.
# Issue: The placeholder text in the date input field, which prompts the correct date format to a user, is not translated.

b. On Universal Access Classic Citizen Portal IEG screens. 

# Open the Citizen Portal application home page with a non-English locale selected.
# Click ?Apply For Benefits?.
# Select the option to start an application without creating an account.
# Select an application that includes at least one date field and navigate to that field.
# Issue: The placeholder text in date fields, which displays the correct date format for a citizen, is not translated.

*Resolution:*
New properties have resolved the issue to provide translation for the date format placeholder text within the date input fields. 

*Technical:*
The following properties have been added to CDEJResources.properties to handle the date format display only (i.e. placeholder text).

* {{Dateformat.LocalizedText}}
* {{Dateseparator.LocalizedText}}

Both properties are defaulted to blank, in which case the date format inside the ApplicationConfiguration.properties file will be used as a fallback for the placeholder text in a date input field.

*Notes for Upgrading:*

*Single-Locale Customer (English locale)*

Single-locale customers running in an English locale will have no upgrade impact.

*Single-Locale Customer (non-English locale)*

Single-locale customers running in a non-English locale most likely have this issue already, insofar as the placeholder text format in their date input fields is the same format as the date format inside ApplicationConfiguration.properties. If those customers want the placeholder text to be in keeping with their locale, they can provide the format in a localized version of CDEJResources.properties, e.g. CDEJResources_fr.properties, which should be updated with {{Dateformat.LocalizedText=""""aaaa MM jj""""}}, in keeping with the date format in their ApplicationConfiguration.properties file.

*Multi-Locale Customer*

On a multi-locale application (English/French, for example), with date format specified inside ApplicationConfiguration.properties as {{dateformat=""""yyyy MM dd"""",}} the localized version of CDEJResources.properties, e.g. CDEJResources_fr.properties, should be updated with {{Dateformat.LocalizedText=""""aaaa MM jj""""}}.

The error object definition in the Swagger specification is incorrect and inconsistent with the actual error response returned by REST APIs.
There are two key problems:

# The error object definition contains an incorrectly named Error attribute instead of errors.
# The error object definition is missing field and stack_trace attributes, which may not always contain values but should be included for consistency and accuracy.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*
To reproduce the issue, a REST API needs to be invoked.

*Using Swagger UI or a REST client (e.g., Postman):*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Open a new browser tab. The authentication cookies from logging in will be reused by the REST client or Swagger UI tool.
# Invoke a REST API and pass an invalid parameter to force an error (e.g., /Rest/v1/persons/12345xxx).

*Using a command-line tool (e.g., cURL):*

# Programmatically call the /Res/j&#95security&#95check URL.
# Retrieve the LTPA token from the response cookie header.
# Add the LTPA token to the cookie request header for all API calls.
# Call an existing REST API with an invalid parameter (e.g., /Rest/v1/persons/12345xxx).
Issue: The API response contains an errors attribute, along with field and stack&#95trace attributes (if ?curam.trace? is set to ?trace&#95on?), however, the Swagger specification defines the error object as having an Error attribute instead of errors and does not include field or stack&#95trace.

*Resolution:*
The Swagger specification has been updated to:

# Rename the incorrectly named Error attribute to errors.
# Add definitions for the field and stack&#95trace (will now always appear but will not have a value unless ?curam.trace? is set to ?trace&#95on?) attributes, with descriptions indicating that these fields may not always contain values.

SPM-136016,DT037057,Case status in the context panel lacks context for screen reader users,Accessibility,,,,"*Issue Description:*
In some case context panels, the case status appears visually near the case name or reference number. While sighted users can easily view both elements simultaneously, screen reader users must navigate further down the page to access the case status. This status is announced without any descriptive context, which can confuse a caseworker. For example, terms like ?Open? or ?Closed? are read aloud without indicating what they refer to.

*User Interface Impact:* Yes

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Enable a screen reader.
# Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Add the necessary evidence to make the associated product delivery eligible.
# Authorize the application case.
# Navigate to the product delivery case.
# Issue: Screen reader users must navigate past other content to locate the case status, which is positioned separately from the case name or reference number in the context panel and announced without context.

*Resolution:*
The case name, reference number, and status are now grouped in the context panel. A hidden label for screen readers is announced before the case status. As a result, when users navigate to this section, the screen reader now announces the case name, reference number, status label, and status value together, providing clear, contextual information.

The changes to the context panel layout may introduce a scrollbar to accommodate all panel content.

SPM-126377,DT036603,Specific task types are not closed automatically by the application after incoming evidence issues have been resolved,CEF,Business Services,Workflow,,"*Issue Description:*
The following three problematic scenarios relating to tasks have been raised:

Scenario 1: 'No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval' task could be closed off manually even without a supervisor available. 

Scenario 2: 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task does not close automatically when incoming evidence is resolved.

Scenario 3: 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' task can not be manually closed when in-edit evidence is resolved.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

*Scenario 1:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Create an integrated case.
# Create a product delivery case.
# Update the Position and PositionReportingLink database tables as follows. This removes supervisors from the organizational structure.
## UPDATE POSITION SET LEADPOSITIONIND = '0'
## UPDATE POSITIONREPORTINGLINK SET RECORDSTATUS = 'RST2'
# Submit the product delivery for approval.
# Navigate to the tasks tab on the product delivery.
# Click the task ?No Supervisor existing for Case XXXXX submitted for approval.?
# On the task home page, select 'Confirm that the supervisor exists'
# Click Yes on the dialog box to confirm.
# Issue: The task gets closed without the supervisor present.

*Scenario 2:*

# Log in as an administrator.
# Select Evidence Sharing within Rules and Evidence on the shortcuts panel.
# Create an identical evidence-sharing configuration from one integrated case type to another integrated case type.
# Set Trusted Source = No
# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Create two integrated cases for the registered person i.e. the types configured for sharing in the previous step.
# On the first case, navigate to the Evidence tab.
# Add evidence and apply evidence changes.
# On the second case, a 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' task is created within the Tasks tab.
# Navigate to the Evidences tab and select Incoming Evidence.
# Resolve the incoming evidence by adding them to the case.
#  Issue: The task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' is not closed even after the incoming evidence is resolved.

*Scenario 3:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new person.
# Submit an application
# On the application case, delete some evidence that would trigger mandatory evidence validations on the related integrated case.
# Authorize the application case.
# On the integrated case that gets created, evidence failed to activate and a new task 'New In-edit Evidence on Case xxx as evidence failed to activate' is created within the Tasks tab.
# Navigate to the evidence tab and apply changes to activate the evidence on the integrated case.
# A validation error for the mandatory evidence is shown.
# Add the missing evidence and apply evidence changes. 
# Open the task and click Add To My Tasks.
# Now click Close on the task.
# Issue: An error message is displayed preventing the task from being closed: ?Task XXX cannot be closed from this page.?

*Resolution:*
Scenario 1: Validations have been included to confirm that a supervisor exists before the task gets closed.

Scenario 2: This issue has been resolved and the task 'New Incoming Evidence on Case xxx that needs to be resolved' gets closed when all the incoming evidence is resolved.

Scenario 3: It is now possible to manually close the task. A new version of the AdvancedEvidenceSharingInEditTask workflow has been added to facilitate this manual closure.

*Upgrade Impact:*
For Scenario 3, any existing in-progress tasks will be created using the old workflow version. These tasks will not be affected by the new workflow, and a caseworker will still not be able to manually close them. Once the new workflow version is released and deployed, new tasks will be created, and a caseworker will be able to manually close them.

SPM-123729,,Update the ANTLR JAR file to the latest version,Third Party Updates,,,,"ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a grammar perspective, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

ANTLR is used either directly or indirectly in Cúram, including IEG custom function processing, workflow transition condition processing, GraphQL processing and any usages of Classic Rules. 

The version of the ANTLR library has now been updated from 3.3 to 4.9.3. The upgrade to ANTLR 4.9.3 ensures compatibility and functionality for the GraphQL infrastructure provided as part of the REST deliverable. As a result of this upgrade, the following changes have been made to the Cúram deliverable.

* CuramSDEJ/lib/third&#95;party&#95;version.properties - the version of the ANTLR JAR file has been updated.
* CuramCDEJ/lib/ext/jar/antlr-4.9.3.jar  - version of the JAR updated.

SPM-115621,PO08156,It is possible to delete a bank account that has been used for payments,CEF,Dynamic Evidence,Dynamic Evidence,,"*Issue Description:*
A bank account that has been used to issue EFT payments to a client can currently be deleted. The system should prevent deletion of such bank accounts.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce (Generic):*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Click the Evidence tab and use the page-level action to add a new bank account.
# Click the Care and Protection tab and select Cases.
# Use the page-level action to create a new integrated case.
# Add an associated product delivery to the integrated case, setting Delivery Pattern to ?Weekly By Check In Advance?.
# Add the necessary evidence and certification to make the product delivery eligible.
# Submit, approve and activate the product delivery.
# Click the Financials tab and use the page-level action on the Transactions page to issue a payment.
# Select the row-level action ?Cancel Payment? on the issued payment.
# Select Delivery Patterns from the Financials menu, select the Edit action on the current pattern and change to ?Weekly by EFT in Advance on a Monday?
# Re-open the Transactions page  and select the ?Reissue? row level action on the cancelled payment
# Navigate back to the person and delete the bank account.
# Issue: The system allows the bank account to be deleted from the person. 

*Resolution:*
A bank account can only be deleted if it has never been used for payments and is not linked to a case with a payment delivery method set to EFT.

The system enforces this by preventing deletion of any bank account that is or was set up to receive payments, even if no payments were made. The following validation is displayed ?The Bank Account is either in active use on a Case or has been used in the past for case payments, therefore it cannot be deleted.?

If payments still need to be issued on a case, a new destination bank account must be created for the nominee. If a bank account is linked to a case but hasn?t been used for payments, the caseworker can update the case with a different account and then delete the unused one. Once a bank account has been used for any payment, it cannot be deleted.
