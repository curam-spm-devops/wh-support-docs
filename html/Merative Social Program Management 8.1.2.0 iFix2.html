This has now been corrected so that a modal will be assigned a size based on the width specified in the WINDOW_OPTIONS parameter of the corresponding UIM page.<br/><br/>This may impact a customer’s existing wizards by fixing pages that had previously displayed at the wrong size.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

These are columns containing mixed contents including a text field. It excludes compound columns with checkboxes, radio buttons or any other widgets.  <br/><br/>It should be noted that as per standard sortable columns, this will increase the width of the newly sortable columns by a small amount due to the additional space reserved for the sorting icons.

During the migration of PDCAddress evidence, the value of the ‘address’ field in the DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute table is incorrectly copied. This field serves as a foreign key to an Address entity. Instead, the Address and its associated AddressElement records should be migrated, and the value of the DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute for the ‘address’ should be updated to reflect the primary key of the migrated Address entity.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No.<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register a person.<li>Run the PECMigrationBatch job.<li>Review the migrated DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute records for PDCAddress.<li>Issue: The value of the DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute row with name ‘address’ has the same value as the original PDC record.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>When the PECMigrationBatch job migrates DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute rows for PDCAddress evidence, it now migrates the Address and AddressElement records where the ADDRESSID matches the ‘value’ in the DynamicEvidenceDataAttribute row with the name ‘address’. It then re-links the value to the ADDRESSID of the migrated Address record.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>

To resolve this problem a server restart is required and the page can then be reloaded successfully.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>AppResource entries with name prefixed with DynEvd_ are removed from the AppResource database table.<li>The Application is started in a Cluster configuration where multiple Application Server nodes are started.<li> The Application experiences high load with regard to Dynamic Evidence Maintenance operations across clustered nodes.<li>Issue: A sporadic 404 response is returned for a user requested Dynamic Evidence Page during an evidence maintenance operation. This results in the User seeing the ‘The page you have requested is not available.’ message. The issue occurs because of problems trying to access AppResource table data under load conditions. The failed access attempt is final on affected node and no further attempts to load that Dynamic Evidence Page can be made on that node until restart.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The solution is to prevent the need for server restart whenever an attempt to load a Dynamic Evidence Page fails. During infrastructure UI Component Model Cache loading, the infrastructure will attempt further retries on Dynamic Evidence pages that failed to load, thereby allowing the User to reload a failed page.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>
