<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-129886"></a>WorkItem:SPM-129886 - Person Evidence Management enhancement<br/><p>Person Evidence Management provides a new approach to managing person evidence. Caseworkers can now use Person Evidence Management to maintain evidence centrally at the person level. <br/><br/>A complete lifecycle of evidence management is provided at the person level allowing caseworkers to interact with person evidence using an Evidence Workspace. This workspace provides an Evidence Dashboard, as well as Active and In-edit evidence lists. The evidence associated with a person is not tied to any specific case. This independence allows caseworkers to access the latest version of evidence and verification statuses without needing to navigate across multiple integrated cases. <br/><br/>This approach enhances efficiency by providing caseworkers with a dedicated space to manage evidence related to individuals, thereby improving accessibility and ensuring the most up-to-date information is available without being constrained by case-specific access permissions.<br/><br/><br/></p></p>
