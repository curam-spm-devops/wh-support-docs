There was a flaw in the logic that generated the deduction financial components. If it detected that a closed deduction financial component associated with a case deduction item was previously processed into an instruction line item and that this case deduction item now had an end date specified, it was removed from the list and wasn’t considered for processing. The logic has been updated so that the case deduction item is only removed if the end date of the configured case deduction is no later than the last paid to date on the case. <br><br><br><p></p><p></p>

The issue observed is that the overflow menu and menu items are not displayed in the overflow menu to the user.</li><li>When there are conditional (CONDITION element) menu items configured for a list action menu, and the condition on the last menu item is not satisfied. The issue observed is that the overflow menu and menu items within it are not displayed to the user. It should be noted if there is a conditional menu item preceding the last one and its condition is also not satisfied, the issue is not observed.</li></ol><h5>Workaround</h5><br><br>There are two potential workarounds:<br><ol><li>Disable the line list action menu feature, by logging in as a system administrator and setting the ‘Display list action menu items inline’ property to false. Select the Publish button for the feature to be disabled across the application.</li><li>Leave the feature enabled but apply an update per page to turn off the feature where the issue is observed. This can be done by setting an attribute in the UIM/VIM file for the LIST element on the affected page where TYPE="LIST_ROW_MENU".  The attribute to be added is MAX_INLINE_ITEMS="0". For pages affected in the custom component, the update can be applied directly to the affected UIM/VIM file. However, for OOTB (out of the box) pages affected - such as the ICProduct_listNominee page - the affected file would need to be copied over to the custom component and the update made there. The affected file for this page is the webclient/components/core/Integrated Case/Product Delivery/Nominee/ICProduct_listNomineeView1.vim file.</li></ol><b>NOTE:</b> We would recommend the 1st workaround (disable this feature) if several pages in the application are observed in the application with this issue.<br><br><br><p></p><p></p>
