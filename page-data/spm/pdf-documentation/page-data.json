Program Management's accessibility statement and conformance, browser zoom, section shortcut panel accessibility, and pod accessibility from February 2023, see the [Cúram Accessibility Guide PDF (February 2023)](/pdf/accessibility/CuramAccessibilityGuide_February2023.pdf).\n\n### Authoring Scripts using Intelligent Evidence Gathering PDF\n\n- For the QuickAddList feature updates to the \"Display elements\" section from September 2022, see the [Authoring Scripts using Intelligent Evidence Gathering (IEG) PDF (September 2022)](/pdf/CE/AuthoringScriptsUsingIEG_September22.pdf).\n\n### Clarification of IBM MQ support on Red Hat® OpenShift®\n\n- The following update applies to the [Messaging architecture](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=architecture-messaging) page in the *Cúram on Kubernetes* section.\n\n  This note requires clarification:\n  \n  **Note:** Social Program Management supports only IBM MQ on a VM. IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.\n\n  The note should read as follows:\n\n  **Note:** Social Program Management supports IBM MQ LTS on VMs only. IBM MQ CD is supported only as a container on OpenShift. IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a Service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.\n\n## Social Program Management public GitHub documentation and repositories\n\nThe following list outlines where you can find further documentation and resources in public GitHub repositories:\n\n- [Cúram on Kubernetes Runbook](https://merative.github.io/curam-kubernetes/)\n- [Cúram SPM Performance Tuning](https://github.com/merative/curam-performance-tuning)\n- [Custom-UI-Reporter](https://github.com/merative/Custom-UI-Reporter)\n- [Merative SPM UI Add-ons Development Environment](https://merative.github.io/spm-ui-addon-devenv/)\n- [Merative SPM Virtual Assistant Cookbook](https://merative.github.io/spm-chatbot/)\n- [SPM Citizen Engagement](https://github.com/Merative/spm-citizen-engagement/tree/main/custom-sso-mfa)\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/wh-support-docs/wh-support-docs/src/pages/spm/pdf-documentation/index.mdx"}}},
