IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.\n\n  The note should read as follows:\n\n  **Note:** Social Program Management supports IBM MQ LTS on VMs only. IBM MQ CD is supported only as a container on OpenShift. IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a Service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.\n\n## Social Program Management public GitHub documentation and repositories\n\nThe following list outlines where you can find further documentation and resources in public GitHub repositories:\n\n- [Cúram on Kubernetes Runbook](https://merative.github.io/curam-kubernetes/)\n- [Cúram SPM Performance Tuning](https://github.com/merative/curam-performance-tuning)\n- [Custom-UI-Reporter](https://github.com/merative/Custom-UI-Reporter)\n- [Merative SPM UI Add-ons Development Environment](https://merative.github.io/spm-ui-addon-devenv/)\n- [Merative SPM Virtual Assistant Cookbook](https://merative.github.io/spm-chatbot/)\n- [SPM Citizen Engagement](https://github.com/Merative/spm-citizen-engagement/tree/main/custom-sso-mfa)\n\n## Supporting Materials​\n\nSecurity Bulletins and documentation for system generated Tasks & Notifications are\nnow available via the Merative Support Portal​\n\n\nTo access:​\n\n- Log in to Merative Support <https://merative.my.site.com/mysupport/s/>​\n- Enter your credentials​\n- Navigate to Knowledge Base, then Article Search, select \"Curam Knowledge\" as the\nData Category Group and then select the relevant Data Category.​\n\n​\nIf you don’t yet have access, please submit a request through the portal.​\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"13d30e51eef530405ffa9a700c571c4c","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":156},"frontmatter":{"title":"Product documentation and PDFs","description":null},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Product documentation and PDFs\ndescription: \n---\n\nMost of the Merative™ Social Program Management documentation is currently available in PDF format only.
