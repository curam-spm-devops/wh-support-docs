The optimum DPI setting is Normal size.\n\nChrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari release new versions frequently and install updates automatically by default. Merative Cúram releases (V.R.M.F releases only) are generally tested on the latest version (for Chrome and Edge, stable releases only) of these browsers available at the start of the development cycle; if tested with no issues Merative will certify that version. The prerequisites advise the version that is certified at each new product release. If for any reason, Merative Cúram are unable to certify for that version, it may be necessary to revert back to a version that is previously fully certified. While Merative will support customers on newer versions of these browsers than the last certified version, they should understand that they have not been fully tested.\n\n#### Standard desktop browser support\n\nWhile every effort is made to ensure that internal case worker application pages use standard web technologies and formats that are compatible with all browsers, only the listed browsers are officially supported.\n\n#### Universal Access desktop browser support\n\nUniversal Access has been specifically developed for public facing applications so browser support has been extended in this area.\n\n* For information about browser support for the Universal Access Responsive Web Application, see the prerequisites and supported software in the [Universal Access Responsive Web Application documentation](/spm/pdf-documentation#citizen-engagement).\n* While every effort is made to ensure that the classic Universal Access application uses standard web technologies and formats that are compatible with all browsers, only the listed browsers are officially supported.\n\n|Supported software|Version|Details|\n|------------------|-------|-------|\n|Google Chrome|142 and future fix packs|This browser is supported for both the Universal Access and Case Worker applications.
