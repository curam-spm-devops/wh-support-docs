V8.2.1.0 includes enhancements to our technical infrastructure and user experience.\n\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n\n#### Support for Java 21 on WebLogic 14.1.2  \nIn advance of Oracle ending support for Java 8 in Dec 2030, Cúram is enhancing our solution to support Java 21\n* In **v8.2.0.0**, we introduced support for Java 21 for IBM Liberty  application server using IBM MQ for containerised deployments. \n* Now, with **v8.2.1.0**, we have extended Java 21 support to include WebLogic application server, upgrading to WLS 14.1.2. \nWe continue to support Java 8 on WebSphere application server, Liberty and WebLogic and encourage customers to make plans to transition to modern java.\n\n\n\n#### Extending support for Containerisation  \nWith the **8.2.1.0 Modern Java release**, we’ve further expanded our container orchestration platform support. \n* Starting **v7.0.11** Curam introduced container support for **OpenShift**. \n* In **v8.2.0.0**, we introduced support for **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. \n* Now, with **v8.2.1.0**, we’re adding support for **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. \nThis enhancement provides greater flexibility and choice for deploying Curam in modern containerized environments. \n\n### User Experience\n\n#### New Enhancements to Streamline Eligibility and Entitlement Processing \nWe’re excited to announce two key improvements designed to make workflows more efficient for customers managing multiple benefit programs: \n\n* **Evidence Management at Application Case** - Allows caseworker to decide whether specific evidence changes should be activated together, once, or separately providing control to streamline the process when appropriate. \n\n* **Verification Proof Sharing** - We've introduced **automation** to streamline the sharing of verification documentation.  When adding **Verification Proof** to an active evidence record, you can now configure Curam to **automatically share** the corresponding verification documentation to other cases. \nThis means less manual work and faster sharing of critical proof, simplifies caseworker experience and improves accuracy for Health and Human Services organizations. \n\n\n#### Task and Notification documentation     \nDocumentation on the business processes in Platform and Insurance Affordability that trigger Tasks and Notifications is now available from the  Knowledge Base section of the support portal.  \nThis provides customers with the information they need to decide which Tasks and Notifications they want to retain to best suit their requirements. \n\n#### Accessibility – Caseworker and Clients \nCúram is compliant with WCAG 2.1 level AA with exceptions. The 8.2.1.0 release continues our commitment to ensuring our systems meet recognized industry accessibility standards with additional enhancements across numerous WCAG 2.1 criteria to improve accessibility for both clients and caseworkers.  \n\nFor more details about these features, see the [What's new in 8.2.1.0](/pdf/spm/Curam_WhatsNew_821.pdf) and the [8.2.1.0 release notes](/pdf/releasenotes/curam8210.pdf).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"581f04cea501cc1f3ceae1c84497b1cb","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":152},"frontmatter":{"title":"8.2.1.0 is now available","description":"8.2.1.0 is now available"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: 8.2.1.0 is now available\ndescription: 8.2.1.0 is now available\n---\n\n## Cúram by Merative 8.2.1.0\n\nCúram by Merative™  is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process.
