V8.2.0.0 includes enhancements to our user experience and new options for technical platform.\n\n\n### Technical Evolution\n\n#### Support for Java 21 on Liberty for containers  \nDue to the Oracle announcement that support for Java 8 will end in Dec 2030, we have introduced support for Java 21 for IBM Liberty  application server using IBM MQ for containerised deployments. Future releases will support additional deployment models.  We continue to support Java 8 on WebSphere application server, Liberty and WebLogic. Customers can stay on Java 8 or transition to the modern java platform by choosing the appropriate version of the installer.\n\n#### Extended support for Containerisation\nWith our 8.2 Modern Java release, we’ve expanded our container orchestration platform support beyond OpenShift to include:\n- Production support for Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n- Dev/Test support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\n\nThis expansion enables our clients to scale applications more efficiently, enhance system resilience, and accelerate innovation through cloud-native architectures.\n\n### User Experience\n\n#### Accessibility – Caseworker and Clients \nAt Merative, we are committed to ensuring our systems meet recognized industry accessibility standards. The 8.2.0.0 release continues on this commitment with additional enhancements across numerous WCAG 2.1 criteria to improve accessibility for both clients and caseworkers. \n\n\n#### Improved readability    \nTo improve readability of pages and modals in the caseworker application, the label font size was increased.  Font size and weight were also increased for the shortcut menu.\n\n\n\nFor more details about these features, see the [What's new in 8.2.0.0](/pdf/spm/Curam_WhatsNew_82.pdf) and the [8.2.0.0 release notes](/pdf/releasenotes/curam8200.pdf).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d9b69cbd41e8e0460a8464ad28e6d212","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":151},"frontmatter":{"title":"8.2.0.0 is now available","description":"8.2.0.0 is now available"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: 8.2.0.0 is now available\ndescription: 8.2.0.0 is now available\n---\n\n## Cúram by Merative 8.2.0.0\n\nCúram by Merative™ is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process.
