The 8.1.3 release includes enhancements across numerous WCAG 2.1 criteria to improve accessibility for both clients and caseworkers. These enhancement vary in nature; from additional metadata to ensure screen readers can correctly and intuitively convey everything on the page, removing truncation of data for better readability, e.g. data in context panel, to more visual changes on the UI such as labels for each distinct element of a phone number or changing how task list pages conveys for each task if, and with whom, a task is being worked on by. \n\n#### Field Validations – enhanced CE capability \nWe’ve streamlined the Citizen application by reducing unnecessary scrolling, making it easier for users to identify errors quickly. This improvement not only enhances the overall user experience but also ensures greater accessibility for individuals using screen readers, fostering inclusivity. \n\nTo enable accessible server-side validations CE version 7.4.0 or later is required. \n\n### Developer productivity\n\n#### DB Support  \nIntroduced support for IBM DB2 community edition for customers to use in development and test environments reducing overall costs of IBM DB2 licences that are required. In addition, we have upgraded the version of H2 that we support, providing greater compatibility with Oracle reducing rework. \n\n#### Authentication  \nThe Cúram Login Module has been enhanced with dedicated modules for SAML and OIDC authentication on IBM WebSphere Liberty. New features include internal and external user verification, Alternate login ID support and efficient security cache population—eliminating the need for server restarts when adding users. Authentication events are now logged in the AuthenticationLog table for enhanced auditing and traceability.\n\n\n### Performance \n\nContinuous investment in our infrastructure ensures Cúram performs at scale and is ready to meet your cloud and expansion strategies.  In 8.1.3 we have improved batch performance of 2 critical processes, reassessments and financials, and improved the operation of Kubernetes PODS and startup times. \n\n### Licence Amendment- Bundled Software  \n\nAfter conducting a comprehensive review of our customers' utilization of bundled software products, we have reached the decision to officially withdraw this entitlement from the Cúram 8.1.3 release. The majority of customers do not utilize the bundled software due to the limitations inherent in these products and, as such, will not be affected by this update.   \n\nShould you believe that you are impacted by this change, we encourage you to contact your Cúram Account Executive.   \n\n\n\n\nFor more details about these features, see the [What's new in 8.1.3](/pdf/spm/Curam_WhatsNew_813.pdf) and the [8.1.3 release notes](/pdf/releasenotes/curam813.pdf).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"cb1ff56d00849c1a3242b66b50be39ac","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":150},"frontmatter":{"title":"8.1.3 is now available","description":"8.1.3 is now available"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: 8.1.3 is now available\ndescription: 8.1.3 is now available\n---\n\n## Cúram 8.1.3\n\nCúram by Merative™  is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process. v8.1.3 includes enhancements to our user experience and developer productivity.\n\n### User Experience\n\n#### Accessibility – Caseworker and Clients \nAt Merative, we are committed to ensuring our systems meet recognized industry accessibility standards.
